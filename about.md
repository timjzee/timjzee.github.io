Hi! My name is Tim. I'm a linguistics major and especially enjoy thinking about and tinkering with speech. Sometimes I write scripts in [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).

You can find my LinkedIn profile [here.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-zee-387a5336/)
