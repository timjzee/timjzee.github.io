Those events which materially influence our future destinies often ", "derive thier origin from a", " trivial occurence.  Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate I ", "desire", " therefore in this account of my early years to state those facts which led to my predeliction for that science. When I was eleven years old we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near", " Thonon. T", "he inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the Works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy the theory that he attempted to ddemonstrate and the wonderful facts that he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light dawned upon my mind and bounding with joy I communicated my discovery to my father. I cannot help here remarking the many opportunities instructors", " posess", " of directing the attention of their pupils to useful knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book \u2014 and said Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! \u2014 My dear Victor do not waste your time upon this \u2013 it is sad trash. If instead of this remark or rather exclamation my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded.  and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater power than the ancient because the powers of the ancient were pretended and chimerical, while those of the moderns are real and practical; under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and with my imagination warmed as it was  ", "sh", "ould probably have aplied myself to the more rational theory of chemistry which ", "has resulted from modern discoveries It is even possible that the train of my ideas might never have recieved that fatal impulse which led me to my ruin. that fatal impulse which led me to my ruin.", " But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. When I returned home, my first care was to procure the", " whole", " works of this author and afterwards those of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of the", "se", " authors with delight, they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself; and, although I often wished to ", "communicate", " these secret stores of knowledge to my father yet his in definite censure of my favorite Agrippa, always withheld me. I disclosed my secret to Elizabeth therefore, under a strict promise of secrecy; but she did not interest herself in ", "the subject,", " and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone. \u2013. It may appear very strange that a desci ple of Albertus Magnus should arise in the eighteenth century, but our family was not scientifical, and I ", "had", " not attend", "ed", " any of the lectures given at Geneva. My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality, and I entered with the greates diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the ", "or if you chose petrum philosophale elixer of life", ". But the latter obtained my most undi ved attention; wealth was an inferior object but what would be the glory of the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invunerable to any b", "ut a", " violent death. Nor were these my only visions, the raising of ghosts or devils ", "was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors; the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; & if my incantations were always unsuccessful & if my incantations were always unsuccessful", " attributed ", "the failure", " rather to my own inexperience and mistake, than ", "to a", " want of skill ", "or fidelity", " in my instructor", "s", ". The natural ph\u00e6nonema that takes place every day before our eyes did not escape my exa", "m", " i", " n", "ations.    \u2013 stillation of which my favorite authors were utterly ignorant excited my astonishment, but my utmost wonder was ", "engaged by some experiements on an air pump", " which I saw ", "employed", " by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting. The ignorance of my philosopher", "s", "  on these and several other points, served to decrease", " thier", " credit with me \u2013 but I could not entirely throw them aside before ", "some", " other system ", "should", " occup", "y", " d their place", ",", " in my mind\u2013. When I was about fourteen years old we were at our house near Belrive when we witnessed a violent ", "and", " terrible thunder storm it advanced from behind Jura  burst at once with frightful loudness. from various quarters of the heavens I and remained while ", "the storm", " lasted watching its its progress with curiosity & delight. ", "As I stood at the door on a sudden", ", I beheld ", "a stream of", " fire issue from an old and beautiful oak about twenty yards from our house and ", "so soon as", " the dazzling light  vanished, the oak had dissappeared ", "&", " nothing remained but a blasted stump. . When we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands of wood.  I never saw any thing so utterly destroyed. The catastrophe of the tree excited my extreme astonishment ", "Among other questions suggested by natural objects", " I eagerly enquired of my father", " the nature & the origin of", " thunder and lightening. He replied, electricity; describing at the same time the effect of that power. He ", "constructed", " a small electrical machine and exhibited a few experiments and made a kite with a wire ", "&", " string ", "which", " drew down that fluid from the clouds. This last stroke compleated the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of my imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel enclined to commence any modern system and this", " disinclination", " was influenced by the following circumstance. My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon natural philosophy, to which I ", "cheerfully", " consented ", "Some accident prevented my attending the these lectures until it was nearly finihsed. The lecture which I attended being thus almost the last lecture which I attended being thus almost the last ", " in his course ", "was entirely incomprehensible to me.", " \u2013 the professor talked with the greatest fluency of potassium & Boron \u2013 of sulphats and oxids", " terms", " to which I could affix ", "no", " idea: I was disgusted with a science that appeared to me to contain only words. From this time untill I went to Colledge I entirely neglected my formerly adored study of the science of", " natural philosophy", " although I still read with delight Pliny and Buffons authors in my estimation ", "of nearly equal interest & utility. ", "My ", "occupations", " at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of the branches of study appertaining to that science. I was also busily employed in learning languages Latin was ", "already", " familiar to me and I began to read without the help of the ", "lexicon", " some of the easiest greek authors. \u2013I also understood English & german perfectly: this is list of my accomplishments at ", "the age of", " and you may conceive that my hours were fully employd in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various literature. Another task also devolved upon me when I became the instructor of my brothers. Ernest was five years younger than myself, and was my principal pupil. He had been aflicted with ill health from his infancy ", "thro which", " Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses his disposition was gentle but he was incapable any severe application. William the younge", "st", " of our family was quite a child and the most beautiful little fellow in the world, his lively blue eyes dimpled cheeks and endearing manners inspired the tenderest affection. Such was our domestic circle from which care and pain seemed for ever banished. My father directed our studies and my mother partook of our enjoyments. neither of us possessed an envied preheminence over the other the voice of command was never heard among us but mutual affection engaged us all to comply with", ",", " & ", "to", " obey the slightest desire of each other. When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should ", "become a student at", " the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be", " made ", "acquainted with other customs ", "than", " those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date. But before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurred: an omen ", "as it were", " of my future misery >Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever but her illness was not severe and she quickly recovered. During her confinement many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother ", "to refrain from", " to attend upon her. She had yielded ", "to our entreaties,", " but when she heard that her favourite was recovering, she ", "c", "ould no longer debar herself from her society, and entered her sick cham ber long before ", "the danger of infection was past", ". The consequences of this imprudence were fatal: on the third day my mother sickened. Her fever was malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst evil. On her death bed the fortitude and benignity of ", "this admirable woman", " did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. \"My \"children said she it was on your \"union that my firmest hopes of \"future happiness were placed. It \"will now be the consolation of \"your father. Elizabeth, my \"love, supply my place to \"your young cousins. Alas! I regret ", "than I am", " taken from you, \" and happy and beloved, as I am \"is it not hard to quit you all? But \"these are not thoughts befitting me \"I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to \"death and will indulge a hope \" of meeting you \"in another world.\" She died calmly and her features expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreperable evil; the void that every where presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom they saw every day, and whose very existence appeared a part of theirs, can have departed for ever: that the brightness of a loved eye can have", " been extinguished,", " and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days. But when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the bitterness of grief commences", ", Yet, from whom", " who has not  that rude hand ", "rent away some dear connection,", " and why ", "should", " I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? ", "T", "he time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays on the lips, although it is deemed sacriledge, is not Banished.\u2013 My mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest ", "and learn to think ourselves fortunate,  whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. ", "My journey to Ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon, I obtain", "ed", " from my father ", "a", " respite of some weeks. This time was spent sadly. My mothers death and my speedy departure depressed our spirits but Elizabeth endeavoured to ", "renew the spirit", " of cheer fullness in our little society. Since the death of her aunt her mind acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to fulfil her duties with the greatest exactitude and ", "she felt that the", " most imperious duty ", "of", " render", "ing", " her uncle and cousins happy.", " had devolved on her.", " She consoled me, amused her uncle, instructed my brothers and I never beheld her so enchanting as at this time when she was continually endeavouring to contribute to the happiness of others entirely forgetful of herself. The day of my departure at lenghth arrived \u2013 I had taken leave of all my friends excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly lamented that he was ", "unable", " to accompany me But his father could not ", "be persuaded", " to part with him intend", "ing that he should", " become a partner with him in his business, and ", " in compliance with his favourite theory, that learning was superflous in the commerce of ordinary life.", " Henry had a refined mind he ", "had no desire", " to be idle and was well pleased to become  his father's partner but he believed that a man might be a very good trader and yet ", "posess", " a cultivated understanding. We sate late listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the future. The next morning early I departed. Tears gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure, and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to have taken place three months before when a mothers blessing would have accompanied me. I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to give mutual pleasure; I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own ", "protector.", " My life had hitherto been remarkably retired and domestic and this had given me an invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers Elizabeth and Clerval these were \"old familiar faces\" but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey But as I proceeded my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired knowledge", " I had", " often when at home thought ", "it", " hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place  and ", "had", " longed to enter into the world and take my station among other human beings. now my desires were complyed with & it would indeed", " have", " be", "en", " folly to repent. I had ", "sufficient", " leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing \u2013 at length the steeples of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. and among others to M. Krempe Professor of Natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true with fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The professor stared. \"Have you really\" said he \"spent \"your time in studying such \"nonsence?\" I replied in the affirmative. \"Every minute\"\u2013 continued M. Krempe with warmth,\" every instant that \"you have wasted upon those \"books is utterly and entirely lost. \"You have burdened your \" memory with exploded \"systems and useless names. Good \"God in what desart land have you \"lived where no one was kind \"enough to inform you \"that these fancies which you have \"so greedily imbibed are a \"thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient. I little expected \"in this enlightened and scientific age \"to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir \"you must begin your studies entirely anew.\" So saying he ste", "pp", "ed aside, and wrote down a list of several books upon natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the next week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy ", " in its general relations;", " and that M. W. aldham a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days which he missed. I returned home not dissapointed for I had long considered the authors useless which the professor had so strongly reprobated \u2013 but I did not feel very much enclined to study those books which at his recommondation I had procured. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance and the teacher did not prepossess me in favour of his ", "doctrine.", " Besides I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and ", "power", ";\u2013 such views although futile were grand; but now ", "the scene", " was changed.", " the ambition of enquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur, for realities of little worth. ", "Such were my reflections during two or three days spent almost in solitude: but as the ensueing week commenced I thought of the information Mr. K. rempe had given me concerning the lectures, and although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit I recollected what he had said of Mr. Waldham, whom I had never seen as he had been hitherto out of town. Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness I went into the lecturing room which Mr. Waldham entered shortly after. This Professor was a very different man from his colleague. He was about fifty but with aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black. He was short in person but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture with a", " by a recapitulation of the", " history of chemistry and  men of learning pronoucing the names of the greatest discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of ", "the science,", " and explained many of its terms. ", "After making", " a few preparatory experiments ", "he", " concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the words of which I shall never forget. \"The ancient teachers of this science\" said he, \"promised impossibilities \"and performed nothing. The modern \"masters promise very little. They know that metals cannot be \"transmuted and that the elixir is a chim\u00e6ra. But \"these philosophers whose hands \"appear only made to dabble in \"dirt and their eyes to pore over \"the microscope or cruscible, \"have indeed performed miracles. \"They penetrate into the recesses of \"nature and show how she works \"in her hiding places. They ascend into \"the heavens", ";", "\u2013 they have discoverd how \"the blood circulates, and the nature \"of the air we breathe. They have \"acquired new and almost unlimited powers", ";", "\u2013 They can command the \"thunders of heaven, mimick the \"earthquake, and even mock the \"invisible world with its own \"shadows.\" I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture & paid him a visit the same evening. His manners in private were even more mild & attractive than in public. For there was a certain dignity in his manner during his lectures which was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness in his own house. He heard my little narration concerning my studies with attention smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus but without the contempt that Mr Krempe had", " expressed to them", ". ", "He said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern natural philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge They", " had", " left to us, as an easier task to give new names, & arrange in conected classifications the facts which they to a great degree ha", "d", " been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever failed. in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.", " I listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption & then added that his lecture had removed my prejudice against modern chemists and I requested at the same time his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. \"I am happy\" said Mr. Waldham, \"To \"have gained a desciple and if if your application equals your ability \"I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural \"philosophy in which the greatest improvements have ", "been", " & may be made. \"It is on that account that I \"chose it for my peculiar study. But \"at the same time I did not neglect the \"other sciences. A man would make \"a very sorry chemist if he atteneded to that department alone. If \"your wish is really to become a \"man of science and not merely \"a pretty experimentalist I should \"advi", "s", "e you to apply to every \"branch of natural philosophy ", "including", " \"Mathematics.\" He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me ", "the use of", " his various machines ", "instructing me as to", " what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his ", "own", " when I should have advanced far enough in the study not to des derange their. mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested and I took my leave. Thus ended a day memorable to me for it decided my destiny. From this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry became nearly my sole study. I read with ardour those books so full of genius and discrimination", " which modern enquirers", " on these subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university; and I found even in Mr Krempe a great deal of sound sense & real information combined it is true with a repulsive phisiognomy & manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished ever", "y", " idea of pedantry. It was perhaps the amiable character of this man that enclined me more to the study of that branch of natural philosophy which he professed than an intrinsic love for the science itself. But this", " state of mind had place ", "only in the first steps towards knowledge; ", "the more fully", " I entered into", " science ", "the more I ", "pursued", " it for its own sake. That application which at first had been a matter of duty ", "& resolution,", " now became so ardent and eager that the stars often dissapeared ", "in the light of morning", " while I was yet ", "engaged", " in my labrotary. As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved rapidly. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the master. Professor Krempe often asked me with a sly smile how Cornelius Agrippa went on", "; while M. Waldham expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.", " Two years passed in this manner during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced it can conceive of the enticements of science\u2013 In other studies you go as far as others have", " g", "one before you and there is nothing more to ", "know,", " learn, but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity who closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study\u2014And I who continually ", "sought  the attainment of", " one", " object ", "and ", "was", " wra", "pt", " up in this ", "sole pursuit", " improved so rapidly that at the end of the two years I made ", "some", " discoveries in the improvement of some chemical ", "instruments", " which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I arrived at this point, ", "and had learned all the professors at Ingolstadt were qualified to teach", " my residence ", "there being", " no longer conducive to my improvement, I thought of returning to my friends and to my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay. One of those ph\u00e6nonoma which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame; and indeed that of any animal endued with life. Whence I often asked myself did this principle of life proceed. It was a bold question, and one ", "which", " has ever been considered as a mystery. Yet how many things are we on the brink of becoming acquainted with if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain ", "our enquiries?", ". I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined from thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to th", "ose", " branch", "es", " of natural philosophy which ", "relate to", " phisiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient. I must also observe the natural decay & corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed by ^", "no", " supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember having trembled at ", "tale of superstition", " or to have feared the apparition of ", "a", " spirit Darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely ^", "as", " the receptacle of bodies deprived of life and ", "which", " from being the seat of beauty & strength ^", "become", " food for the worm.  now I was", " led", " to examine the cause & progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and Charnel houses. I My attention was fixed upon every ", "object the most insupportable to the delicacy of", " the human feelings. \u2013I saw how the fine form of man", " was", " degraded and wasted. I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life \u2013 ", "I saw", " how the worm ", "inherited", " the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examin", "ing", " and anal", "yzing all the minuti\u00e6 of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death, & death to life,", " untill from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me. A light so brilliant & wondrous yet so simple that while ", "I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated,", " I was surprised that I among so many men of genius who had applied to the same science that I alone should discover this astonishing secret. Remember I am not recording the vision of a madman \u2013 the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that wh", "ich", " I now ", "affirm,", " is true. Some miracle might have produced it. But the stages of discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible ", "labour", " and fatigue I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation & life. Nay more, I ", "became", " myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.  The surprise ", "which", " I at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. to arrive at onece at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying circumstance that could have occurred. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps ", "by which I had been", " progressively led to it were obliterated. and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now ", "within", " my grasp; Not that, like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once. The information I had obtained was ", "of a nature", " rather ", "so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished.", " I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light. I see by your eargerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted", "; that cannot be.", " Listen patiently to the end of my story and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.\u2014 I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction & infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town the world, than he aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. When I found ", "so", " astonishing", " a", " power placed ", "within", " my hands", ",", " I hesitated a long time concerning the ", "manner in which", " I should ", "employ", " it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a ", "frame", " for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles & veins ", "still remained", " a work of inconceivable difficulty & labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a ", "being", " like myself or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to ", "give life to", " an animal as complex and wonderful as man. ", "The materials at present within my command", " hardly appeared adequate to so ardous an undertaking; ", "but I doubted not that I should ul-timately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses, my operations be baffled incessantly, & at last my work be but imperfect, yet, when I considered", " the improvement which every day takes place in science and ", "mechanics I was encouraged to hope", " my ", "present", " attempts would ", "at least lay the foundations of future success Nor, could I consider", " I did not think that the magnitude and ", "complexity", " of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. ", "I", "t was with these feelings ", "that", " I began the creation of a human being. As the ", "minuteness", " of the parts ", "formed", " a great hindrance to my speed I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make", " the being", " of a gigantic stature; that is to say about seven or eight feet in height, and proportionably large. after having formed this determination and having spent some months in", " successfully collecting & arranging", " my materials, I began. No one can conceive the variety of feelings which pressed upon me during this time. When success raised me to enthusiasm life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break ", "thro,", " and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new ", "existence", " would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent ", "natures", " would owe their", " being", " to me.  no father could claim the gratitude of his child ", "so completely as I should deserve thiers", " pur sueing ", "these", " reflections I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. These thoughts supported my spirits while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek", " had grown", " pale with study, and my person", " became", " emaciated by confinement. sometimes on the very brink of certainty I faild yet I still clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I clung and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed & breathless eagerness I pursued nature to her most secret hiding places who shall ", "concieve the horrors of my", " secret ", "toil", " as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the living animal to animate ", "the", " lifeless clay? my limbs", " now", " tremble and my eyes swim with the rememberance, but then a resistless and almost frantic", " impulse", " urged me", " forward", "; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for one pursuit. It was indeed a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness ", "so soon as", " the unnatural stimulus ceas", "ing", " to operate, and I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from Charnel houses and with profane fingers meddled with the secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber\u2013or rather cell at the top of the house and seperated from all other appartments by a gallery and staircase I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the minuti\u00e6 of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials, and often did my human nature turn from my occupation ", "whilst", " still urged on by an eagerness which ", "perpetually", " encreased,", " I brought", " my work near ", "to", " a conclusion. The Summer months passed while I was thus ", "engaged,", " heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season: never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yeild a more luxuriant vintage. But my eyes were", " insensible", " to the charms of nature & the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew that my silence disquieted them and I well remembered the words of my father. \"I know that while \"you are pleased with yourself you \"will think of us with affection \"and we shall hear regularly from \"you. And you must pardon me \"if I regard any interruption \"in your corespondence, as a proof \"that your other ", "duties", " are equally neglected\" I knew well therefore what his would be ", "his feelings", " but I could not tear my thoughts from my occupation loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished as it were to procrastinate ", "all that related to", " my feelings of affection, untill the great object ", "which swallowed up every habit", " of my nature should be compleated. I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was he was in the right in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or ^a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is any exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind. If this rule ", "were", " always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with his tranquillity and ", "his", " domestic affections Greece had never been enslaved, C\u00e6sar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the Empires of Mexico & Peru had not been destroyed. But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interresting part of my tale; and your looks remind me to proceed. My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my silence by enquiring more particularly than before what my occupations were. Winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves \u2013 sights which before had alway yeilded me supreme delight. so ", "deeply", " was I ", "engrossed in", " my occupation. The leaves of that year were withered before my work drew near a close. And now every day shewed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholsome trade than an artist occupied in his favourite employment. Every night a slow fever oppressed me and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a a disease I regretted ", "the", " more because I had hitherto enjoyed excellent health & had always boasted of ", "the", " firm", "ness of my", " nerves. But I believed that exercise and amusement would soon drive away ", "such", " symtoms and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be comple", "te", ". It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld my man complete ed", ",", ". with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony I collected instruments of life around me that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning, the rain pattered dismally against the window panes, & my candle was nearly burnt out, when by the glimmer of the half extinguished light I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open.\u2014It breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.  How can I describe my emotion at this catastrophe; or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form. His limbs were in proportion and I had selected his features as", " beautiful. Beautiful", "; Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was", " of a lustrous black &", " flowing and his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxurianc i es only formed a more horrid contrast with his watry eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and strait black lips. The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceed", "ed", " moderation; but now that I had succeeded these dreams vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the ", "being", " I had created, I rushed out of the room and", " continued", " a long time traversing my bed chamber unable to compose my mind to sleep. At lenght lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on my bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfullness. But it was in vain; I slept indeed but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams\u2013 I saw Elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of Ingolstadt; delighted & surprised I embraced her but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became lurid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms", ":", " A shroud envolepped her form & I saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel; I started from my sleep with horror, a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb", " became", " convulsed, when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch \u2014 the miserable monster whom I had created; he held up the curtain, and his eyes", "\u2014", "; if eyes they may be called,\u2014 were fixed on me\u2013His jaws opened and he muttered some ", "inarticulate sounds", " while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken but I did not hear \u2014 one hand was stretched out to detain me but I escaped and rushed down stairs I took refuge in a court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained", " during ", "the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation; listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the arrival of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserabl", "y", " given life. Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. Amummy again endued with ", "animation", " could not be so hideous as He. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then. But when those muscles and joints were endued with motion it became a thing such as even Dante could never have conceived. I passed the night wretchedly\u2013 sometimes my pulses beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery: At others I nearly sunk to the ground ", "thro", " languor and extreme weakness. and mingled with this horror I felt the bitterness of disappointment: Dreams that had been my food and rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me\u2013 and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete. Morning \u2014 dismal and wet \u2014 at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolsstadt its white steeple & its clock which pointed to the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my assylum and I issued into the streets, pacing ", "them", " with quick steps as if I sought to", " avoid ", "the wretch whom I feared every turning in the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the appartment which I inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although wetted by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. I continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing: my heart palpitated ", "in the sickness of", " fear and I hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me, es ome road \"doth walk in fear and dread \"and having once turned round walks on And turns no more his head \"Because he knows a frightful fiend \"doth close behind him tread.\" Continueing thus, I came at lenght", " opposite to", " the Inn at which the diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused I knew not why but remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the doors being opened I perceived Henry Clerval, who on seeing me instantly sprung out. \"My dear Frankenstien,\" exclaimed he \"How glad I am to see you; how \"fortunate ", "that", " you should be here at the ", "very", " moment of my alighting.\" Nothing could equal my delight on seing Clerval: his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune. I felt", " suddenly, and", " for the first time ", "during", " for many months", ",", " calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner & we walked towards my colledge. Clerval continued talking for some time about ", "our mutual", " friends and his ", "own", " good fortune in being allowed to come to Ingolstadt. \"You may believe,\" said he, \"it was not with considerable \"trouble that I persuaded my \"father that it is not absolutely \"necessary for a merchant to \"know nothing except bookeeping \"and indeed I believe I left him \"incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my applications \"was the same as ", "that of", " the dutch school \"master in the Vicar of Wakefield\u2013 \" I have ten thousand florins\u2013 \"a year without greek \u2013I \"eat heartily \"without greek \"But his affection for me at \"length overcame his dislike for \"learning, and he permitted me \"to ", "under", "take a voyage ", "of discovery", " to the land of \"knowledge.\" \"And my father, brothers & Elizabeth\" said I. \"Very well & very happy\" replied he \"only a little uneasy that \"they hear from you so seldom, & \"by the bye, I mean to lecture you \"a little upon their account \"myself\u2013 But my dear Frankenstein\" continued he stopping short & gazing \"full in my face \"I did not before \"remark how very ill you are. So thin \"and pale; you appear as if you had \"been watching for several nights.\" \"You have guessed right\" I replied \"I have lately been so engaged in", " one", " occupation that I ", "have", " \"not allow", "ed", " myself sufficient rest as you \"see", ";", " but I hope", ",", " I sincerely hope all those \"occupations are at an end\u2014I am free \"now I hope.\" I trembled excessively: I could not bear to think of", ",", " & far less to allude to the occurences of the preceding night. I walked therefore with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my colledge. I then reflected \u2013 and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom I had left in my appartment might be still there\u2014alive and walking about. I dreaded to see him but I dreaded still more that Henry should behold the monst er. entreat", "ing", " him ", "therefore", " to remain a few minute", "s", " at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock before I recovered myself, when I paused and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side. But nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in \u2013 the appartment was empty, and my bedroon was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me; but when I ", "became", " assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Henry. We ascended into my room & presently the servant brought breakfast: but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me,\u2013I felt my flesh tingle with the excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place \u2014 I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands & laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival\u2013 but when he observed me ", "more attentively", " he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him. My dear Frankenstein,\" cried he \"What for God's sake is the matter do not laugh so \u2013 How ill you are! What is the cause of all this? Do not ask me cried I, putting my hand s before my eyes, for I thought I saw the spectre glide into the room \u2013 He can tell! Oh save me save me\"\u2013 I imagined that the monster seized me I struggled furiously & fell down in a fit. Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings. A meeting which he had anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness. But I did not witness his grief for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time. This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. during all this time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey & wretched Elizabeth would be he had spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind & attentive nurse than himself, and firm in the hope he had of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them. But I was in reality very ill & surely nothing but the unbounded & unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed life was for ever before", " my", " eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless My words surprised Henry \u2013 he at first believed them the wanderings of my disordered imagination but the  per", "t", "inacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject", " persuaded him that my disorder owed its origin to some uncommon & terrible event. ", " by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed & grieved my friend I recovered. I remember that the first time I was capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure", ",", " I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that young buds were shooting forth from the trees. It was a divine spring & the season no doubt contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in ", "my", " bosom", ",", " my gloom disappeared and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion . \"Dearest Clerval,\" said I \"How kind", ",", " \"how very good you are to me. This \"whole winter instead of spending it in study as you promised yourself, \"has been consumed in my sick room: \"how shall I ever repay you? I feel \"the greatest remorse for the disappointment I have been the occasion of\u2013 But you will forgive me.\" \"You will repay me,\" replied Henry, \"if you do not dis compose yourself; \"but get well as fast as you can. And \"since you appear in such good \"spirits I may speak to you on \"one subject; may I not?\" I trembled; one subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think. Do not frighten yourself,\" said Clerval, who observed my change of colour,\" I will not mention \"it if it agitates you. But your father \"and cousin would be so happy if they received a letter from you in \"your own hand \u2013 They hardly know how \"ill you have been, and are uneasy \"at your long silence.\" Is that all? \"I said smiling \"My dear Henry how could you suppose \"that my first thoughts would not \"fly towards those dear, dear friends \"whom I love and who are so deserving \"of my love.\" \"If this is your present temper\" said Henry \"you will be glad perhaps \"to see a letter that has been lying here some day", "s", " it is from your \"cousin I believe.\" He then put the following letter into my hands. \"To V. Frankenstien Geneva March 18 th 17\u2014 \"My dear Cousin. \"I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your health. We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the extent of your disorder, for it is now several months since we have seen your handwriting and all this time you have been obliged to dictate to Henry \u2013 Surely Victor you must have been very ill and this makes us very wretched as much so nearly as after the death of your dear mother. My father was almost persuaded ", "that you were indeed dangerously ill,", " and could hardly", " be", " restrain", "ed", " from ", "undertaking", " a journey to Ingolstadt. Clerval always writes that you were getting better I eagerly hope you will confirm this", " intelligence", " soon in your own handwriting for indeed, indeed Victor we are all very miserable on this account. Relieve us from this fear and we shall be the happiest creatures in the world.\u2013 My uncles health is now vigorous that he appears ten years younger since last winter. Ernest also is so much improved, that you would hardly know him; he is now nearly sixteen you know and has lost that sickly appearance that he had some years ago \u2013 he is quite well & hearty if I may use that term for it is very expressive. \"My uncle and I conversed last night a long time about what profession Ernest should follow. His constant ill health when young has deprived him of the habit of application and now that he enjoys good health he is continually in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I, therefore, proposed that he should", " be", " a farmer which you know cousin is a favourite scheme of mine \u2013A farmer's is a very healthy happy life; and the least hurtful or rather the most benificial profession.", " of any.", " My uncle had an idea of his being", " educated as", " an advocate, ", "that", " through his interrest", " he might become", " a judge. But besides that he is not at all fit for such an occupation, it is certainly ", "more creditable", " to cultivate the earth for the sustenance of man than to be the confid", "a", "nt & sometimes ", "the accomplice", " of", " his", " vices; which is the employment", " & ", "of a Lawyer.  I said that ", "the occupation of a prosperous", " farmer if it were not a more honourable it was at least a happier employment than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was always to meddle with the dark side of human nature My uncle smiled and said that I ought to be an advocate myself; which put an end to the conversation on that subject. story that will please you. Do you not remember Justine ? Moritz? Perhaps you do not I will therefore tell you her story in a few words. Mad. Martin her Mother was a widow with four children of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father but", " thro", " an odd perversity her Mother could not endure her and after the death of M. Moritz treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years old prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.", " The republican institutions of our country, have produced simpler & happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less dis", " I dare say that you now remember all about it, for Justine was a great favourite of yours, & I", " recollect", " you once said, that if you were in an ill humour one glance from Justine, could dissipate it ", "for", " the same reason that Ariosto gave concerning the beauty of Angelica:\u2013 she looked so frank hearted and happy. My Aunt", " concieved an attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world. I do not mean that she made any professions\u2013I never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eye that she almost adored her protectress. Although very gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my Aunt\u2013 she thought her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her words and even her man ners, so that even now she often reminds me of her. When my dearest Aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine who had attended her during her illness with the greatest affection. Poor Justine was very ill but other tryals were reserved for her. had died and her mother was now with the exception of her neglected daugher left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled and she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement sent from heaven to chastise her partiallit y she was a roman Catholic and I believe her confessor encouraged the idea which she had concieved.. Accordingly, a few Months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant Mother. Poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt: grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her Mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftenor accused her as having caused the deaths of her brothers & sister. Perpetual fretting at last threw Mad. Martin into a decline, which at first encreased her irritability, but she is now at rest for ever; she died on the first approach of cold at the beginning of this last winter . Justine has returned to us and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and extremely mild & pretty and as I mentioned before her mein and her expressions continually remind me of my dear Aunt.  I must say a few words to you also, My dear Victor, of little darling William. I wish you could see him. He is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair When he smiles two little dimples appear on his cheeks which are rosy with health \u2014 his chin comes down in a beautiful oval After this description I can only say what our visitors say a thousand times a day\u2013'He is too pretty for a boy'. He has already had one or two little wives but Louisa Biron is his favourite\u2013 a pretty little girl of five years old  Now, dear Victor I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip about your acquaintance. The pretty Miss Mansfeld has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne Esq. Her ugly sister Manon married M. Hofland the rich banker last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow Louis Manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva But he has already recovered his spirits and he reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty french woman\u2014 Mad. Tavernier \u2013She is a widow and much older than Manoir but she is much admired and a favourite with every body. I have written myself into good spirits, dear Cousin yet I can not conclude without again anxiously enquiring concerning your health\u2014 Dear Victor, if you are not very ill write yourself and make your father and all of us happy or\u2014 I cannot bear to think on the other side of the question my tears already flow Your very affectionate Cousin \u2013 dearest Victor Elizabeth Lavenza write\u2013. \"Dear, dear Elizabeth\" I exclaimed when I had read her letter\"\u2013I will write instantly and relieve them from the great pain they must feel.\" I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly\u2013in another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. And in doing this I underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night \u2013 the end of my labours & the beginning of my misfortunes I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of Natural Philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a Chemical instrument renewed all the agony of my my nervous symtoms. Henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment, for he perceived that I had acquired dislike to the room which had previously been my workshop. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. even my excellent M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress that I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject, but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire as I evidently saw of drawing me out.  What could I do? He meant to please & he tormented me I felt as if he placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not shew the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alledging his ignorance & the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked him from my heart, but I did not speak. I plainly saw that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me, and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my thoughts, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. Mr. Krempe was not equally docile & in my then condition of almost insupportable sensitiveness", " his harsh blunt econiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman \u2014\"Damn \"the fellow,\" cried he \"Why Mr. Clerval \"I tell you he has outstript \"us all\u2013 ay stare if you please but \"it is nevertheless true \u2013 A youngster \"who but three years ago believed \"Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as the gospel has \"now set himself at the head of \"the university & if he is not soon \"pulled down we shall all be out \"of countenance.\u2014Aye, Aye, continued \"he observing my face expressive of suffering \"Mr. Frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in \"a young man; Young men should be \"diffident of themselves you know Mr \"Clerval; I was myself when young but \"one soon grows out of that.\" Mr Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself and that happily turned the conversation from the subject that was so ", "agonizing", " to me. Clerval was no natural philosopher. His imagination was too vivid for the minuti\u00e6 of science. Languages were his principal study for he wished to open a field for self-instruc tion on his return \u2013 Persian Arabic & Hebrew gained his attention ", "so soon as ", "he had become perfectly master of the Greek & Latin languages. For my own part idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that I wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies I found great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. Their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree I never before experienced in studying", " the authors of", " any other country. When you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and gardens of roses \u2013 in the smiles & frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart How different from the manly & ", "heroical ", "poet", "ry", " of Greece & Rome. Summer passed away in these occupations & my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of Autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter & snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarted untill the ", "ensuing", " spring. I felt this delay very bitterly for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange town before he had become acquainted with its inhabitants. The winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated its dilatoriness. The month of May was already compleated, and I expected daily the letter that was to fix the date of my departure, When Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in environs of Ingolstadt that I might bid farewell to the country I had so long in habited.\u2013 I acceeded with pleasure to this proposition\u2013 I was fond of Exercise and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country. We passed a fortnight in these perambulations. My health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional vigour from the salubrious air I breathed, ", "the natural incidents of our progress", " and the conversation of my friend. Study had before rendered me unsocia", "l,", " \u2013I", " had", " shunned the company of my fellow beings But Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart. he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent Friend! How sincerely did you love me and endeavour to elevate my mind untill it was on a level with your own. A selfish persuit had cramped and narrowed me untill your gentleness & affection warmed & opened my senses.  I became the same happy creature who a few years ago, loving & beloved by all, had no sorrow or care \u2013 when happy  inanimate nature had the power of bes towing on me the most delightful sensations \u2014A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with extasy.\u2013 The present season was indeed divine \u2013 the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud\u2013 I was not disturbed by thoughts that during the preceeding year pressed upon me not withstanding my endeavours to throw them off", " with an invincible burthen.", " Henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathized in my feelings \u2013 he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the feelings that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing. his conversation was full of imagination and very often, in imitation of the persian & Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and interrest. At other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity. We returned to our colledge on a sunday \u2013 the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared joyful and happy \u2013 my own spirits were high and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity. On my return I found the following letter from my father. To V.\u2013Frankenstein Geneva \u2013 June 2nd\u2013 17\u2014 My dear Victor. You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return and I was at first tempted to write a few lines merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you \u2013 but that would be a cruel kindness and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise , my son, when your expected a happy and gay welcome to beheld on the contrary tears and wretchedness. And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how can I inflict pain on an absent child.? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings. William is dead! That sweet child whose smiles delighted & warmed me who was so gentle yet so gay, Victor, he is Murdered! I will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. Last thurday (May 28th) I; my niece and your two brothers went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that Ernest and William who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat untill they should return. Presently Ernest came & enquired for his brother he said that he had been playing with him and that William had run away to hide himself and that he had vainly sought for him & afterwards waited a long time but that he did not return. This rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him untill night fell; when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house: he was not there \u2013 We returned again with torches for I could not rest when I thought my sweet child had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps & dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About seven in the morning I discovered my lovely boy whom the night before I had seen blooming & active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless\u2013 the print of the murderers finger was on his neck. He was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance revealed the secret to Elizabeth. She was ", "At first I attempted to prevent her", " but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed\u2014 Oh God! I have murdered my darling infant. She fainted and was retored with extreme difficulty; when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh\u2013 She told me that that same evening William had teazed her to let him wear a very valuable miniature she possessed of your Mother. This picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace at present of him, ", "altho", " our exertions ", "to discover him", " are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William. Come, dearest Victor, you alone can console Elizabeth, ", "She", " weeps ", "continually", " & accuses herself unjustly yet her words", " as the cause of his death\u2014", " pierce my heart. We are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to ", "return", " and be our comforter. Your dear Mother! Alas, Victor! I now say Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling.  thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wound of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my son & friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you & not with hatred for your enemies. Your affectionate & afflicted father Alphonse Frankenstein. Clerval who had watched my countenance as I read this letter was surprised in observing the despair that succeeded to the joy I expressed on receiving new", "s", " from my friends. I threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands. \"My dear Frankenstien,\" exclaimed Henry when he saw me weep with bitterness \"are you always to be unhappy? \"my dear friend, what has happened?\" I motioned to him to take up the letter while I walked up & down the room in the most extreme agitation.  \u2013 tears also gushed also from the eyes of Clerval as he read the account of my misfortune \u2013\"I can offer you \"no consolation, my friend,\" said he \"your disaster is irreperable. What \"do you intend to do\"? \"To go instantly to Geneva come with me, Clerval, to order the horses\" During our walk Henry endeavoured to raise my spirits\u2013 He did not do this by the common topics of consolation but by shewing the truest sympathy. \"Poor William\" said \"that dear \"child he now sleeps with his angel \"mother. His friends mourn and weep but \"he is at rest he does not now feel the \"murderers grasp \u2013 a sod covers his \"gentle form and he knows no pain\u2013He \"can no longer be a subject for pity his \"survivors are the greatest sufferers and \"for them time is the only consolation. \"Those maxims of the stoics that death \"was no evil and that the mind of man \"ought to be superior to despair \"on the eternal absence of a beloved \"object ought not to be urged \u2013 even \"Cato wept over the dead body of his \"brother.\" Clerval spoke this as we huried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwads in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived I hurried into a Cabriolet and bad farewell to my friend. My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on for I longed to console & sympathize with my loved and sorrowing friends but when I drew near my native town I slackened my ", "progress", ". I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed though scenes familiar to my youth but which I had not seen for nearly five years, how altered every thing might be ", "since", " that time", "?", " one great sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstance might have by degrees worked other alterations which although it might be done more tranquilly would not be less decisive. Fear overcame me I dared not advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although I was unable to define them. I remained at Lausanne for two days not daring to proceed. I contemplated the lake \u2013 the waters were placid \u2013 all around was calm and the Snowy mountains the \"Palaces of Nature\" were not changed. By degrees, this calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I", " continued my journey", " towards Geneva. The road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as I approached my native town \u2013 I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura; and the ", "bright", " summit of Mount Blanc\u2013 I wept like a child\u2013 Dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer Your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue is this ", "to", " prognosticate peace or to mock", " at", " my unhappiness? I fear, my friend that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and I think of them with pleasure \u2013 My Country my beloved country Who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake Yet as I drew nearer home grief and fear overcame me \u2013 night also closed round and when I could hardly see the dark mountains I felt still more gloomily I pictured every evil and persuaded myself that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings\u2013 Alas! I prophesied truly and failed only", " in one single circumstance:", " that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. Night had closed in when I arrived the gates of Geneva were already shut and I determined to remain that night at Secheron ", "a village half a league to the eastward of the city", ". The ", "sky", " was ", "serene", " and as I was unable to rest I resolved to ", "visit", " the spot where m", "y", " poor William had been murdered; as I walked I perceived a storm collecting on the other side of the lake. I saw the lightnings play in the most beautiful figures and gained a summit that I might observe its progress. It advanced and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly encreased. I quitted my seat and walk on, although the darkness and storm augmented every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head \u2014  It was echoed from Sal\u00eave ", "the Jura", " and the Alps of Savoy\u2014 vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illumin", "ating", " the lake; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness untill the eye recovered itself from the preceeding flash. The storm as is often the case in Switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm ", "hung", " exactly north of the town", " over", " that part ", "of the", " lake ", "which lies between", " the promontory of Belrive and ", "the village of Copet", " \u2014 another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole \u2013 a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. While I watched the storm \u2013 so beautiful yet terrific I wandered on with a hasty step \u2013 th", "e", " noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands & exclaimed aloud \"William, dear angel, this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!\"\u2013 As I said these words I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me \u2013 I stood fixed gazing intently, I could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illumined the object, and discovered to me its gigantic stature", " & the", " deformity", " of its aspect", " more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me who it was. It was the wretch, the filthy d\u00e6mon to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother. No sooner did that idea cross my imagination than I became convinced of its truth \u2014 my teeth chattered and I was forced to lean against a tree for support \u2014 The figure quickly passed me and I lost it in the gloom. He therefore was the murderer! ", "Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact", " \u2014 I thought of pur sueing the devil, but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me ", "hanging among the rocks of the", " nearly perpendicular ascent of the Mont-Sal\u00eave; he soon reached the summit and dissap eared. I remained motionless the thunder ceased but the rain still continued & the scene was inveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind ", "I resolved in my mind", " the events which I had, untill now, sought to forget. ", "The whole train of my progress towards my creation", " The appearance of ", "the work of my own hands, alive", " at my bed side \u2013 ", "&", " its departure. two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life, and was this his first crime \u2013 Alas! I had turned loose in the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in murder & wretchedness; ", "for", " had he not murdered my brother? No one can conceive of the anguish I suff", "e", "red during the remainder of the night which I spent cold & wet in the open air. . But I did not feel the incovenience of the weather. my imagination was busy in in scenes of evil and despair I considered the ", "being", " whom I had cast in among mankind ", "and endowed with the will & the power to effect", " purposes of ", "horror such as the deed which he had now done,", " nearly in the light of my vampire; my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all who were dear to me. Day dawned and I directed my steps towards the town \u2013 the gates were open and I hastened to my father's house .\u2013My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer & cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected what the story was that I had to tell. A ", "being", " whom I myself had created and endued with life, ", "had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain", " The tale was utterly improbable and I knew well that if any other had communicated such a relation to me I should have looked upon it as the ravings of delirium Besides the strange nature of the animal would elude pursuit, even if I were ", "so far", " credited", " as to persuade my relatives to commence it", " \u2013 ", "Besides of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest", " a creature ", "capable of", " scal", "ing", " the", " overhanging", " sides of Mont-Sal\u00eave? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent. It was about five in the morning when I entered my fathers house. I told the servant", "s", " not to disturb the family", ",", " and went into the library to attend their usual time of rising. Five years had elapsed\u2013passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and respectable parent!  He still remained to me. I gazed on a picture of my mother which stood over the mantlepiece. It was an historical piece painted to please my father and represented Caroline Beaumont in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic", ",", " & her cheek pale but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the", " sentiment", " of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William, and my tears flowed when I looked upon it\u2014While I was thus engaged Ernest entered\u2013 he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me. He expressed the greatest delight on seeing me \u2013 \"Welcome my dearest Victor,\" said he, ah I wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous & delighted \u2013 But we are now so unhappy that I am afraid tears instead of smiles will be your welcome our father looks so sorrowful and it seems to have revived in his mind his sorrow for the death of Mamma and poor Elizabeth is quite inconsolable.\" Ernest began to weep as he said these words. \"Do not you\" said I,\" welcome me thus; try to be more calm ", "that I may not be", " absolutely miserable the moment I enter my fathers house after so long an absence. But tell me, How", " does", " my father support his misfortunes; and how is my poor Elizabeth?\" She indeed requires consolation,\" replied Ernest\u2013\" She accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very, very wretched; but since the murderer has been discovered\"\u2014\u2014\" \"The murderer discovered!\" Exclaimed I\u2013 \"Good God how can that be? Who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible, one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountain stream with a straw! \"I do not know what you mean\" replied Ernest, But we were all very unhappy when she was discovered\u2013No one would believe it at first and even now", " Elizabeth will", " not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed who could have believed that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable and fond of all the family could all at once become so extremely wicked.\" \"Justine Moritz!\" cried I, \"poor, poor girl is she then accused \u2013 but it is wrongfully every one knows that. No one believes it surely, Ernest?\" \"No one did at first,\" said my brother, \"but several circumstances came out, ", "will forced conviction upon us", " and her \"own behaviour ", "has been so", " confused ", " as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that I fear leaves no hope for doubt:", " but she \"will tried today and you will then hear \"all?\" He related that the morning on which the murder of poor William ad been discovered  Justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed, and after several days one of the servants happen", "ing", " to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder h", "ad", " discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly shewed it to one of the others, ", "who", " without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate who sent to apprehend Justine. on being charged with the fact she confirmed the suspicion  in a great measure by her extreme confusion. This was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and I replied earnestly. \"You are all mistaken. I know the murderer Justine, poor, good Justine is innocent.\" At that instant my father entered I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and ", "he after we had exchanged our mournful greetings would have spoken on some other topic than that of our disaster had not Ernest exclaimed Good God, Pa pa! Victor says that he knows the murderer of poor William. \" We do also, unfortunately,\" replied my father for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than, have discovered so much depravity & ingratitude in one whom I valued so highly. \"My dear father\" exclaimed I\u2013\"You are mistaken. Justine is innocent.\" \"If she is\" replied my father \"God forbid that she should suffer as guilty \u2013 She is to be tried today and I hope I sincerely hope that she will be acquitted. This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her and in this assurance I calmed myself expecting the trial with eagerness but without prognosticating an evil result. We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had made great alterations in her form since I had last beheld her. Five years before she was a pretty, good humoured girl  Whom every one loved, and caressed. She was now a woman in stature and expression of countenance which was uncommonly lovely \u2014 An open & capacious forehead gave indications of a good understanding joined to great frankness. Her eyes were hazel and  expressive of uncommon mildness now through recent affliction allied to sadness\u2013 Her hair was of a rich dark auburn her complexion fair and her figure slight and graceful. She  welcomed me with the greatest affection \"Your arrival, my dearest cousin,\" said she, \"fills me with hope. You perhaps will find out some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas Who is safe is she were convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our Misfortune is doubly hard to us. We have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate \u2013 Alas if she is condemned I shall never know joy more But she will not I am sure she will not and then I shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little William.\" \"She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I and that shall be proved \u2013 fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her aquittal. \"How kind your are,\" replied Elizabeth, \"every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched that it was impossible, and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\" She wept\u2014 \"Sweet niece\" said my father dry your tears  if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our judges & the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality. ", "We passed a few sad hours untill eleven o'clock when the trial was to commence My  the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I sufferred living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless", " devices", " would cause the death of two of my fellow beings. One a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered with every agravation infamy that could make that murder ", "memorable in horror.", " Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave ; And I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and could not have exculpated her who suffered through me. The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed at and execrated by thousands. For all the kindness which her beauty might have gained from others was obliterated by the rememberance of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evident constrained \u2013 and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated \u2013 a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. The trial began  and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her which would have staggered any one who had not such prof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market- woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. ", "The woman", " asked her what she did there", "?", "\u2013", " but", " she looked very strangely and only returned a confused ", "& unintelligible", " answer. She returned to the house about eight o'clock and when some one enquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking ", "for", " the child and demanded earnestly if any thing had been heard concerning him. When the body was brought into the house she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when Elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same", " which", " an hour before the child had been missed,", " she had", " placed round his neck a murmur of indignation and horror filled the court. Justine was then called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered. Surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to speak she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. \"God knows,\" she said, \"how entirely I am inocent. but I do not pretend to be acquitted on account of my protestations I rest my innocence on a simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will encline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious. She then related that by the permission of Elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder was perpetrated at the house of an aunt who resided in Ch\u00eane a village about a league from Geneva. On her return about nine o'clock she met a man who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was frightened at this account", ",", " and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of Geneva were shut and she several hours of the night in a cottage, but unable to rest or sleep, she rose early that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge", " That if she had been bewildered", " when questioned by the market woman, was", " not", " surprising when she  was so wretched ", "for", " the loss of poor William. Concerning the picture she could give no account. \"I know,\" continued the unhappy victim \"how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but I have no power of explaining it and when I have expressed my utter ignorance I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked I believe that I have have no enemy on earth  and none surely who could have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if I had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon ? \"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if the", "ir testimony shall not overweigh", " my supposed guilt I ", "must", " be condemned although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.\" Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent and irreproachable dispositions & conduct, about to fail the accused, when although violently agitated she desired permission to speak. \"I am\" said she \"the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for I was educated by and lived with his parents ever since and long before his birth; it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends I wish to be allowed to speak that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with it. I have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and afterwards for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me a most amiable and benevolent creature. She nurst my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and after terwards attended her own mother during a long & tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her. After which she again lived in my uncle's house where she was beloved by all the family. she was warmly attached to the child who has been murdered and acted towards him like a most affectionate Mother. for my own part I do not hesitate to ay that not withstanding all the evidence produced against her I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly wished for it I should have willingly given it her so much do I esteem and value her.\" Excellent Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation was heard, but it was ", "excited by her generous interference", " & not in favour of poor Justine on whom the public indignation", " was", " turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke but she did not answer. My own agitation & anguish was extreme during the whole of the trial.  I believed in her innocence I knew it. Could the monster who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, alo in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy. I could not sustain the horror of my situation and when I saw that the popular voice and the countenance of the Judges had already condemned my unhappy victim I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom\u2013 I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question \u2013 but I was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit \u2014 the ballots had been thrown they were all black & Justine was condemned. I cannot attempt to describe what I then felt \u2013 I had ", "experienced", " sensations of horror before and I have endeavoured to bestow on them adequate expressions but now words cannot convey any idea of the heart sickening despair that I endured. The person to whom I had addressed myself also added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. \"That evidence\" he observed \u2013\"was hardly required in so glaring a case but I am glad of it; and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive.\" When I returned home Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. \"My cousin\" replied I, \"it is decided as you may have suspected \u2013 all Judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape: but she has confessed.\" This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth who had relied with firmness on her innocence. \"Alas!\" said she \"How shall I ever again believe in human benovolence \u2013 Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister. How could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray\u2013 her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill humour and yet she has committed a murder.\" Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgement and feelings to decide. \"Yes,\" said Elizabeth \"I will go although she is guilty \u2013 and you Victor shall acco pany me \u2013I cannot go alone\". The idea of this visit was torture to me yet I could not refuse. We entered the gloomy prison cham ber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the further end; her hands were mannacled and her head rested on her knees,\u2013 she rose on seeing us and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also \u2013 Oh Justine said she, why did you rob me of my last consolation \u2013 I relied on your innocence and although I was very wretched I was not so miserable as I am now.\" \"And do you also believe that I am so very very wicked\u2013? Cried Justine Do you also join with my enemies to crush me? Her voice was suffocated with sobs. \"Rise my poor girl,\" said Elizabeth \"why do you kneel if you are innocentI am not one of your enemies, I believed in your innocence notwithstanding every evidence untill I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report you say is false, and be assured my dear Justine nothing can for a minute shake my confidence in you but your own confession\u2013\" \"I did confess\" said Justine \"but I confessed a lie. I confessed that I might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced untill I almost began to think that I was the wicked wretch he said I was. He threatened excomunication and Hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear Lady, I had none to support me \u2013 all looked on me as a wretch doom to ignominy and perdition; what could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie and now only I am truly miserable.\" She paused, weeping, and then continued. \"I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe that your Justine whom your bessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved, was a wretch capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William, dearest blessed child, I soon shall see you again in heaven & glory and that consoles me going as I am to suffer ignominy and death. \"Oh Justine\" cried the weeping Elizabeth, \"forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you \u2013 why did you confess? But do not mourn my dear girl, I will every where proclaim your innocence and will force belief. Yet you must die \u2013you my companion, my playfellow, my more than sister\u2014 die \u2013I never never can survive so horrible a misfortune\". \"Dear Sweet lady,\" do not weep\"\u2013 replied Justine\"\u2013 you ought to raise me with thoughts of a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of injustice and strife \u2013Do not you, excellent Elizabeth drive me to despair.\" Elizabeth embraced the sufferer \"I will try to comfort you,\" said she, but this I fear is an evil too deep and poignant to admit of consolation for there is no hope Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest Justine, with resignation and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh how I hate all its shews and mockeries.\u2013 When one creature is murdered another is immediately  of life in a slow torturing manner & then the executioners their hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence believe that they have done great deed. The", "y", " call this retribution; hateful name! When that word is pronounced I know that greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever in ventent e d to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is not consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping so miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt & my sweet William \u2013 escaped from light which is hateful to me and the visages of men which \" I abhor. Justine smiled languidly. \"This, dear Lady said she is despair and not resignation. I must not learn the lesson that you would teach me \u2013 talk of somthing else of something that will bring joy and not encrease of misery.\" During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me\u2013 Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the dreary boundary of life & death felt not as I did \u2014 Such deep & bitter agony I gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started when she saw who it was she approached me. \"Dear Sir,\" said she, \"you are very kind to visit me; you I hope do not believe that I am guilty.\" I could not answer \u2013 \"No Justine\" said Elizabeth; \"he is more convinced of your innocence than I was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not  it.\" \"I truly thank him\"\u2013 said Justine \"In these last minutes I feel the sincerest gratitude for those who still think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am \u2013 It removes more than half my misfortune and I feel as if I could die in peace. now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, sweet lady, and your cousin.\" Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she wished for but I the true murderer felt the never dying worm alive ", "which", " allowed no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence like a cloud that passes over the fair moon & for a while hides but cannot ", "destroy", " its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart \u2013 I bore a hell within me that nothing could ", "extinguish. ", "We staid several hours with Justine and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth tore herself away \"I wish\" cried she that I were to die with you \u2013 I cannot live in this world of misery.\" Justine assumed an air of Cheerfullness while she with difficulty repressed the bitter tears \u2013 \"Farewell sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you May this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer. \u2013 live & be happy to make others so. do not know, my dear Victor, how much I am relieved now that I trust in the innocence of this unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace if I had been deceived in my reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe it I felt anguish that I could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. The innocent suffers \u2013 but she whom I thought amiable and good is not wicked and I am consoled.\" Amiable Cousin! Such were your thoughts mild and gentle as your dear eyes and voice. but I.\u2014\u2014 I was a wretch & none ever conceived the misery that I then suffered. Nothing is more painful ", "than the dead calmness of inaction & certainty which", " when the mind has been worked up by a quick succession of events,  follow", "s and", " deprives the soul both of hope or fear. Justine died\u2014 She rested. & I was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair & remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove\u2013 Sleep fled from my eyes. I wandered like an evil spirit for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more much more (I persuaded my self) was yet in store. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and goodness \u2013 I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I could put them in practise and make myself useful to my fellow beings. ", "N", "ow all was blasted", ";", " Instead of serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back on my actions with self satisfaction, and from thence ", "to gather promise of", " new hopes . I was seized by remorse and guilt, and hurried away to a hell ", "of intense tortures such as", " no language can describe. This state of mind ", "preyed upon", " my health which had entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me", ";", " Solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, death-like solitude. My father observed with pain ", "the alteration perceptible in", " my dispositions & habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving way to immoderate grief. \"Do you think, Victor\" said he \"That I do not suffer also\u2013 no one could love a child more than I ", "loved", " your brother\u2013( tears came into his eyes as he said this) but is ", "it", " not ", "a", " duty  to the survivors", " that we should refrain from augmenting", " their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief. It is also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of day", " ly", " usefullness without which no man is fit for society.\" This advice, although good, was utterly innaplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view. About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was very agreable to me in particular. The shutting of the gates of the town regularly at ten o'clock and the impossibility of", " remaining", " on the lake after that hour rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free: often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night I took the boat and passed the night upon the water: sometimes with my sails set I was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted when all was at peace around me and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful & heavenly; if I except alone some bat, or the", " frogs, whose", " harsh and interrupted croaking ", "was", " heard only when I approached the shore; often I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake", " that", " the waters", " might", " close over me & my calamities for ever. But I was restrained when I thought of the heroic & suffering Elizabeth whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. And then I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I not by my base desertion leave them exposed & unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let lose among them? At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind ", " only \u2014", "that I might afford them consolation and happiness \u2014 but that could not be: remorse ", "extinguished", " every hope\u2014 I had been the ", "author", " of unalterable evil, and I lived in daily fear let the monster whom I had created might perpetrate", " some new wickedness.", " \u2013I had a", "n obscure", " feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity would almost efface the recollection of the past. ", "There was always scope for fear so long as anything that I loved remained alive.", " My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived \u2013 When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest", " peak of the", " Andes could I when there have precipitated him to their ", "base", "; I wished but to see him again that I might wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine. Our house was the house of mourning, my father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacriledge towards the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature ", "who in earlier youth had ", "wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with extacy of our future prospects\u2013 She ", "had become", " grave, and often conversed of the inconstancy of fortune and the instability of human life\u2014 \"When I reflect, my dear Cousin,\" she said \"on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works in the same light as they before appeared to me. Before \u2013 I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils", "; At least they were remote, and more familiar to  reason than to imagination", " but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood. Yet I am certainly unjust.\u2013Every one believed that poor girl to be guilty, and if she ", "could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she", " would have been the most depraved of ", "human", " creatures. For the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor & friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own. I could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly I should have thought such a ", "being unfit to remain in the society of men.", " \u2013 Yet she was innocent\u2013I know I feel she was innocent You are of the same opinion and that confirms me. Alas, Victor! when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of precipiece towards which thousands are crowding & endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.\u2013 William & Justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes, wearing human lineaments; he walks about the world free & perhaps respected. But even if I were condemmed to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes I would not change places with such a wretch.\" I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony \u2013 I \u2013 not in deed but in effect was the true murderer.\u2014 Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand said\u2013\"My dearest cousin, you must calm yourself; these events have affected me God knows how deeply! but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of misery and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble; be calm, my beloved Victor, I would sacrifice my life to your peace. We surely shall be happy; quiet in our native country and not mingling in the world what can disturb our tranquillity?\" She shed tears as she said this ", "distrusting the very solace which she gave, but", " at the same time smiled, that she might chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart. My father who saw in the unhappiness that was painted in my face, only an exaggeration of that sorrow which I might naturally feel thought that an amusement suited to my taste would be the best means of restoring to me my wonted serenity \u2013 It was from this cause that he had removed to the country & ", "induced by", " the same reasons he now proposed that we should all take a journey to the Valley of C", "h", "amounix. I had been there before but Elizabeth & Ernest never had, and both had often expressed a wish to see this place which had been described to them as so wonderful & sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva on this tour about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of Justine. The weather was beautiful and if mine had been a sorrow to be chased away by any fleeting circumstance this voyage would certainly have had the effect ", "intended by", " my father . As it was I was", " somewhat", " interrested ", "in the scene..it sometimes lulled, it could not extinguish my grief. during", " The first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the mountains at a distance to which we gradually advanced. We perceived that the valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the Arve whose course we followed, closed upon us by degrees and when the sun had set we saw immense mountains & preci pieces overhanging ", "us", " on ", "every", " side & heard the sound of ", "the river raging among rocks", ", and the dashing of the waterfalls", " around. ", "The next day we pursued our journey on mules and as we ascended still higher; the valley assumed a more beautiful & verdant appearance \u2013 Ruined castles ", "hanging on the precipices of", " piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here & there peeping from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty.. But it was augmented & rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white & shining piramids & domes towered above all like another earth \u2014the habitations of another race of beings We passed the bridge of Pellissier, where the ravine which the river forms opened before us and we began to ascend the mountain which over hung it\u2013. Soon after we entered the Valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful & picturesque as that of Servox; through which we had just passed. The high & snowy mountains were its boundaries but we saw no more ruined castles or fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road, we heard the rumbling thunder of the fallingAvelanche and marked the smoke of its passage.\u2013Mont Blanc, the ", "supreme & magnificent", " Mont Blanc raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley. During this journey I sometimes joined Elizabeth and exerted myself to point out to her the various beauties of the scene.\u2014 And often I suffered my mule to lag behind & indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times I spurred on the animal before my companions that I might forget them, the world, and more than all myself. When at distance I alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror & despair. At eight in the evening we arrived at Chamou nix. My father & Elizabeth were very much fatigued. Ernest who accompanied us was delighted and in high spirits\u2013 The only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the south wind and the rain that that wind seemed to promise for the next day. We retired early to our appartments but not to sleep:\u2013 at least I did not. I remained many hours at the window watching the ", "pallid", " lightning that played above Mont Blanc \u2013 and listening to the rushing of the Arve which ran before my window. The next day, contrary to the prognostics of our guides, was fine although clouded. We visited the source of the Aveiron and rode about the valley ", "until evening", ". These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving They elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquilized it. In some degree, also they diverted my mind from the thoughts ", "over which", " it had brooded for the last month. I returned in the evening, fatigued but less unhappy and convered with the family with more cheerfulness than had been ", "my custom", " for some time. My father was pleased and Elizabeth overjoyed; \"My dear Cousin,\" said she, \"You see what happiness you diffuse when you are ", "happy", "; do not relapse again!\u2014. The following morning the rain poured down in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains. I rose early but felt unusually melancholy. The rain depressed me, my old feelings recurred and I was miserable. I knew how my father would be dissapointed at this sudden change and I wished to avoid him untill I had recovered myself so far as to conceal the feelings that overpowered me \u2014 I knew that they would remain that day at the inn and as I had ever inured myself to rain and cold I resolved to go to the summit of Montanvert alone. I remembered the effect the view of the tremendous and ever moving glacier had ", "produced", " upon my mind when I first saw it", " I", "t had then filled me with a sublime extacy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the ", "obscure", " world to light & joy. The sight of the awful & majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind & causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go alone for I was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene. The ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you surmount the perpedicularity of the mountains\u2013 It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand places the traces of the winter avelanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting ", "rocks", " of the mountain, or ", "transversely", " upon other trees. The path as you ascend higher is inters", "ected by", " ravines ", "of", " snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of the them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as ", "even", " speaking in a loud voice ", "produces", " a  concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction the head of the speaker. The pine", "s", " here are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath.", ";", " Vast mist were rising from the river which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me \u2014 Alas! why does man boast of sensibilities above those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows & by every chance word or scene that that wind may convey to us We rest, A dream has power to poison sleep We rise one wandering thought pollutes the day We feel conceive, or reason \u2013 laugh or weep Embrace fond woe or cast our cares away It is the same \u2013for be it joy or sorrow The path of its departure still is free Mans yesterday may ne'er be like", " h", "is morrow Nought may endure but mutability. It was noon when I arrived at the top of the ", "ascent", ". For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains Presently a breeze dissipated the mist and I descended on the glacier.  \u2013 The surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea, decending low, & in terspered by rifts that sink deep\u2014 The ", "field of", " ice is a league,", " in width,", " but I was nearly two hours ", "in", " crossing it \u2013 The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.\u2013From that side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose Mont Blanc in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful & stupedous scene \u2013 ", "the sea or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependant mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Thier icy & glittering peaks shone in sunlight over the clouds. ", "My heart before", " which was sorrowful, now", " swelled with somthing like joy I exclaimed \u2013 Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life.\" As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed\u2014 He bounded over the crevices in the ice ", "among", " which I had walked with caution, his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man \u2013I was troubled \u2014 a mist covered my eyes and I felt ", "faintness seize me.", " \u2013 The cold breeze of the mountains quickly restored me. I perceived as ", "the shape", " came nearer( sight tremendous and abhorred) that it was the wretch whom I had created . I trembled with rage and horror ", "I", " resolv", "ed", " to wait his approach & then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; I  His countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignancy. But I scarcely observed this\u2013anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of utter detestation and contempt \u2013 \"Devil\" I exclaimed \u2013 \"do you dare approach me and do not you dread the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head \u2013 Begone vile insect or rather Stay that I may trample you to dust and oh that I could with the ", "extinction of", " your miserable existence restore those creatures whom you have diabollicaly murdered\" \"I expect", "ed", " this reception\" said the d\u00e6mon all men hate the wretched \u2013 how then must I be hated who am miserable beyond ", "all living things.", " \u2013 Yet you my creator hate me and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound with ties only dissoluble by the death of one of us.

Vol. II Chap I. \"It is with difficulty that I remember the \u00e6ra of my being. All the events of that period appear confused & indistinct. A strange sensation seized me I saw, felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees I remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that I was obliged to close my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled me.\u2013 But hardly had I felt this when (by opening my eyes as I now suppose) the light poured in upon me again\u2013 I walked and I believe descended; but presently I found a great alteration in my sensations; before dark opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight \u2013 and I now found that I could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid\u2013 The light became more & more opressive to me and the heat wearying me as I walked I sought a place where I could perceive", " recieve", " shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt, and here by the side of a brook I lay for some hours resting from my fatigue untill I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state and I ate some berries which I found ", "hanging", " on the trees or lying on the ground \u2013 I slaked my thirst by the brook and then again lying down I was overcome by sleep; It was dark when I awoke, I felt cold also and half frightened", " as it were instinctively", " on finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your appartment on a sensation of cold I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were in sufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor helpless miserable wretch\u2014I knew & could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides I sat down and wept. Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. I gazed with a kind of wonder \u2013 It moved slowly; but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak with which I\u2013 covered myself, and sat down on the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused I felt the light, and hunger and thirst and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. Several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations ", "from each other\u2013", ". I ", "gradually saw plainly", " the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound ", "which", " often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little ", "winged", " animals who often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to see with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant light which canopied me.\u2013some times I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable\u2014 Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode but ", "the", " unco", "u", "th and innarticu late sound ", "which", " broke from me frightened me into silence again. again with a lessened form it shewed itself while I still remained in the forest. My sensations were by this time become distinct & my mind received every day aditional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees one herb from another \u2013 I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes ", "whilst", " those of the blackbird were sweet and enticing. one day when I was oppressed by cold I found a fire that had been left by some wandering beggars and was over come with delight", " at the warmth which I experienced from it.", " In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it away with a cry pain\u2013 How strange, I thought, that the same cause should at once produce such opposite effects \u2013I examined the materials of the fire, & to my joy found it to be wood \u2013I quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood I had placed near the heat dried, and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great", " quantity", " of wood that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply ", "oof fire.", " When night came on and ", "brought with it", " sleep, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves & then placed upon that wet branches and then spreading my cloak I on the ground & sunk into sleep.  It was morning when I awoke & my first care was to visit the fire \u2013I uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when thy were nearly extinguished. When night again came I found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and the discovery of this element was useful to me also in my food\u2013 for I found some of offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered; I tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner, placing them on the live embers\u2013 I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts much improved. Food however became very scarce and I often spent a day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this resolved to quit the place which I had hitherto inhabited & to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of my fire\u2013I had obtained it by strange means and knew not how to reproduce it. ", "this deficiency", " obtained my serious consideration for several hours but I was obliged to ", "relinquish all attempts to supply it, ", "and wrapping myself up in my cloak I struck across the wood towards the setting sun \u2013 I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country \u2013 A great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearrance was disconsolate and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground \u2013 It was about seven in the morning and I longed to obtain food and shelter. At length I perceived a small hut which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepheard. This was a new sight to me and I examined the structure of it with great curiosity. finding the door open I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire ", "over", " which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quiting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His flight somewhat surprised me \u2013 but I was inchanted with the appearance of the hut. Here the snow and rain could not penetrate \u2013 the ground was dry  and it presented to me then as exquisite & divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the dominions of Hell", " after thier suffocation in the lake of fire. ", "I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread, cheese, milk & rhenish wine; the latter of which however I did not like. Then overcome by fatigue I lay down among some straw & fell asleep. It was noon when I awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun I determined to recommence my travels\u2013& depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, untill at sunset I ", "arrived at", " a village. How miraculous did this appear. The huts the neater cottages & statelier houses engaged my admiration by turns\u2013 The vegetables in the garden", "s", " and the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages", " allured me\u2014", " One of the best of these I entered\u2013 but I had hardly placed my foot ", "within", " the door before the children shrieked and one of the  women fainted, the village was roused some fled,\u2014some attacked me untill grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapon I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low ", "hovel", " \u2013quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.\u2013 This ", "hovel", " however adjoined a cottage of a neat & pleasant appearance, but after my late ", "dearly", " bought experience I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor of the cottage but it was dry and although the wind entered by innumerable chinks I found it an agreable assylum from the snow & rain Here I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter from the inclemency of the season & still more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my assylum that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the kennel that I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the", " the", " sides which were exposed by a pigstye & \u2013clear pool of water one part was open and by that I had crept in but now I covered every crevice with stones & wood by which I might be discovered yet in such a manner that I could move them on an occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the stye and that was sufficient for me. Having thus arranged my dwelling & carpeted it with clean straw, I retired for I saw the figure of a man at a distance and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which I purloined and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of", " the", " pure water which flowed by my", " retreat", " \u2013 The floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the kitchen fire of the cottage it was tolerably warm. Being thus provided I determined to reside in this hovel untill something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain dropping branches & the dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step and looking through a small chink a beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle dem\u00e6nour unlike what I have since found Cottagers and farm house servants to be \u2013 Yet she was meanly dressed \u2013 a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned; she looked patient yet sad. She passed away but in a quarter of an hour returned, bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burthen a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper desponc e nsces ly; uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it into the cottage himself. She followed , and they disappeared \u2013 Presently I saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field opposite the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the cottage and sometimes in the yard where she fed some chickens. While I examined my dwelling I discovered that part of the cottage window had formerly occupied a corner of it but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small & allmost imperceptible chink, through which the eye could just penetrate; ", "thro this chink", " a small room ", "was visible,", " whitewashed & clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire ", "sate", " an old man leaning his head on his hand in a disconslate attitude \u2014  The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took somthing out of a drawer which employed her hands & sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or nightingale. It was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. the silver hairs & benevolent countenance of aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I percieved drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took ", "no", " notice it untill she sobbed audibly \u2013 He then pronounced a few sounds and the poor creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness & love that I felt ", "sensations of a peculiar & overpowering", " mixture", " of pain & pleasure; such as I had never experienced either from hunger or cold, or warmth or food and I nature they were a", " mixture", " of pain & pleasure; such as I had never experienced either from hunger or cold, or warmth or food and I", " from my station withdrew", " unable to bear", " these emotions. Soon after this the young man returned bearing on his sholders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of it into the cottage placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he shewed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese", ".\u2014", " She seemed pleased and went into the garden for soome roots & plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire\u2013. She afterwards continued her work ", "whilst", " the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging & pul pulling up roots\u2013 \u2013After he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him, & they returned to the cottage together \u2013 The old man in the mean time had been pensive but on the approach of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.  the meal was quickly dispatched; the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the door in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence & love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his feautures were moulded with the finest ", "symmetry", " \u2013 yet his eyes & attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondencency\u2014 The old man returned to the cottage; and the youth with tools different from those ", "which", " he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields\u2013 Night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was pleased to find that setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours", ".", " \u2013In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations;", " which", " I did not then understand, & the old man again took that instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. ", "So soon as", " he had finished the youth began,\u2013 not to play", ",", "\u2013 but", " to", " utter sounds which were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument or the songs of the birds I since found that he read ", "aloud", ", but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.  The family soon extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to . rest. I lay on my straw but I could not sleep \u2013 I thought of the occurences of the day.\u2013 What cheifly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them but dared not.\u2014 I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct I might hereafter consider it proper to pursue that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motive of their actions.\u2014. cottagers arose the next morning before the sun;\u2013 The young woman arranged the cottage & prepared the food; & the youth mounted on a large strange animal rode away. This day was passed in the same routine ", "as", " the preceeding one. The young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations ", "within..", "\u2014 The old man whom I soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours in playing on his instrument or in contemplation \u2013 Nothing could exceed the love & respect that the younger cottagers ", "shewed", " towards this venerable old man \u2013 They performed towards him every little office of ", "affection", " & duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles. happy\u2013The young man & his companion, often retired into a corner of their common room and wept. I saw no cause for this unhappiness but I was deeply affected by it \u2013 If such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched\u2014 yet why were these gentle beings unhappy \u2013 they possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury. they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry\u2013 they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one anothers company & speech \u2014 and interchanged each day looks of affection & kindness\u2013 What did their tears mean? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many of the appearances which at first seemed", " enigmatic", ". A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one", " of the ", "cause", "s", " of the uneasiness of this amiable family \u2013 It was poverty\u2013 and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree\u2013 their nourishment consisted entirely of bread the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure any food for it. They often I believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the ", "two", " younger for several times they placed food before the old man when they had none for themselves \u2013This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which I ", "gathered from", " a neighbouring wood. I discovered also another means by which I was able to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire\u2013and during the night I often took his tools the use of which I quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days\u2013 I remember the first time ", "that", " I did this, the young woman who opened the door in the morning ", "appeared", " greatly ", "astonished", " to see a great pile of wood on the outside \u2013 she said some words in a loud voice, & presently the youth joined her who also appeared astonished. I observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage & in cultivating the garden.\u2014. By degrees also I made another discovery of still greater moment ", "to me", " I found that these people ", "posessed", " a", " method", " of communicating their ", "experience & feelings ", "to one another by articulate sounds which they uttered \u2014 I percieved that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure pain, smiles or sadness in the minds & countenances of the hearers\u2013 This was indeed a Godlike science and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it\u2013But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose Their pronunciation was quick & the words they uttered not having any apparent connexion with visible objects I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unrable the mystery of their ", "reference.", ". By great application however and after having remained ", "during the space of", " several revolutions of the moon in my hovel I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects", " of discourse, ", "I learned & applied the words fire, milk bread & wood I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves\u2013 the youth & his companion had h each of them several but the old man had only one which was Father \u2013 the girl was call Sister or Agatha and the youth Felix. brother or son I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words without being able ", "as yet", " to understand or apply them \u2013 Such as good dearest \u2013 unhappy. I spent the winter in this manner\u2013 the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me\u2013When the", " y", " were unhappy I felt depressed and I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners & rude gait only enhanced to me the superior advantages of my friends. The old man, I could percieve, often endeavoured to encourage his children as I sometimes found that he called them. ", "to cast off their melancholy.", " He would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even on me; Agatha listened with respect\u2013 her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unpercieved but I generally found that her manners and tone were more cheerful after having listen end to the exhortations of her father It was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the groupe And even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister expecially when he addressed the old man\u2014. I could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers . In the midst of poverty and want Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the fist little white flower that peeped out from beneath the ", "snowy", " ground Early in the morning before she had risen he had cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milkhouse", ";", " drew water from the well and brought the wood from the ", "outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.", " In the day I believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, ", "because", " he often went ", "forth,", " and did not return untill dinner, yet brought no wood with him:\u2013 at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he often read to the old man and Agatha. This reading had puzzled me extremely at first \u2013 but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked; I conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was Sometime elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one ", " which ", "could not fail to impress itself deeply ", "on", " my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting & wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was. The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was decended from a good family in France  where for many years he had lived in affluence respected by his superiors & beloved by his equals.  His son was bred in the service of his country & Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months ", "before", " my arrival they had lived in a large & luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends & possessed of every enjoyment that ", "which", " virtue ", "& refinement of intellect & taste, ", "ac afford. The father of Safie had been the cause of their", " ruin;", " He was a Turkish Merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years. When his person became ", "for some reason which I could not learn", " obnoxious to the government\u2013 He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried & condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant All Paris were indignant & it was judged that his religion and wealth ", "rather ", "than the crime alledged against him", " had been the cause of his condemnation ", "Felix was present at his trial; his horror & indignation w", "ere", " uncontrolable when he heard the", " decision of the court.", " He made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him & then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the ", "prison", " he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the ", "building,", " which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan, who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to ", "kindle", " the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward & wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt Yet when he saw the lovely Safie who was allowed to visit her father & who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil & hazard. The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on heart of Felix  and endeavored to secure him more entirely by the promise of her hand in marriage; Felix was too delicate to accept this", " offer", " yet he looked forward to the probability of that event as the consummation of his happiness.  During the ensueing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant. the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl Who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her Fathers who understood french. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended kindness, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate. I have copies of these letters for I found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and they were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. before I depart I will give them to you they will prove to you the truth of my tale but at present as the sun already begins to decline I shall only have time to repeat the substance to you Safie related that her Mother was a Christian Arab seized and made a slave by the Turks. recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of Safie who married her. The young girl spoke in high & enthusiastic terms of her 60 Mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now", " reduced.", ". She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion & taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect & an independance of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. This Lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed in the mind of Safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to ", "Asia", " and the being immurred in walls of a haram allowed only to occupy herself with puerile amusements ill-suited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas & a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her. The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he had quitted prison & before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix has procurred passports in the name of his father sister & himself. He communicated hi plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey & concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of Paris. Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons & across Mount Cenis when he arrived at Leghorn where the merchant", " had decided to", " wait a favourable opportunity of passing over to Africa He could not deny himself the pleasure of remaining a few days in the society of the Arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest & tenderest affection. They conversed with one another by the aid of an interpreter & Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliver", "er", " if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they at that time imhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit untill it was no longer necessary; and then ", "to", " carry his daughter to Africa with him. His plans were greatly facillitated by the news", " which", " arrived from Paris. The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to discover and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered & De Lacey & Agathat were thrown intto prison The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind & aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air & the society of her he loved. This idea was torture to him \u2013 He arranged with the Turk if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy Safie should remain as a boarder in a convent at Leghorn and then quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris & delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free De Lacey & Agatha by this proceeding. He did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and exiled them for ever ", "condemned them to a perpetual exile from", " their native country. They found a miserable assylum in the cottage in Germany where I found them Felix learned that the treacherous Turk for whom he and his family endured such unheard of oppression, on ", "discovering was thus", " that his deliverer. The Turk informed Safie of his intentions and and rank the merchant commander his daughter to think no more of her lover but to repare to return to her native country with him.\u2013The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command \u2013She attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical . A few days after the Turk entered his daughters appartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence in Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered ", "up", " to the French Government\u2013 He had consequently hired a vessel to convey hin to Constantinople ", "for", " which ", "city", " he should sail in few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.  Safie revolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her \u2013 her religion & feelings were alike adverse to it. By some papers of her fathers that fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he resided. She hesitated some time but at length she formed her resolution \u2014Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a small sum of money; she quitted Italy with an attendant a native of Leghorn but who understood ", "Arabic", " and departed for Germany. She arrived in safety at a town about 20 leagues from the Cottage of De Lacey \u2013 her attendant then fell dangerously ill Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died & the Arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.\u2013 She fell however in to good hands\u2013  The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive safely at the cottage of her lover. Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply, I learned from ", " the views of social life which it developed", " to admire their virtues & to deprecate the vices of mankind. As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence & generosity were ever present before me \u2013 ", "inciting in me to desire to become an actor", " in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance ", "which occurred", " in the beginning of the month of August of ", "the same", " year. One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress & some books. I eagerly seized the prize & returned with it to my hovel. The books were fortunately written in the language ", "the elements of which", " I had learned at the cottage; they consisted of \"Paradise Lost\" \u2014 a volume of Plutarchs lives and the Sorrows of Werter \u2013 the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight I could continually study and ", "exercise", " my mind upon the", "se histories", " when my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations. I can hardly describe to you the effect ", "of", " these books . They produced in me an infinity of new images & ideas that sometimes raised me to extacy but more frequently sunk me to the lowest dejection. In the Sorrows of Werter besides the interrest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me ", "obscure", " subects that I found in it a never end source of speculation. ", "& astonishment.", " The gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments, and feelings ", "which had for their object something out of self", " accorded well with my experience among my protectors. ", "and with the wants which were for ever alive within my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld, or imagined. His character contained no pretention but it sunk deep \u2013 The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. \u2013 I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet I inclined towards the opinion of the Hero whose extinction I wept without precisely understanding it. As I read however I applied much personally to my own feelings & condition I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener \u2013 I sympathized with & partly understood them\u2013 but I was unformed in mind. I was dependant on none, & related to none \u2013 \"The path of my departure was free\"! and there was none to lament my annihilation \u2013 My person was hideous and my stature gigantic \u2013 What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? ", "these questions continually recurred but I was unable to solve them. The volume of Plutarchs lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics\u2013 This book had a far different effect upon me from the letters of Werter. I learned from ", "Werter's imaginations", " despondency & gloom; but Plutarch taught me high thoughts\u2014he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire & love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my unterstanding and experience I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms & wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns & large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school ", "in which", " I ", "had", " studied human nature \u2014 But this book developed new & mightier scenes of action I read of men concerned in public affairs governing or masser cring their speceis. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as I understood the signification of those terms relative as they were , as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.. Induced by these feelings I was of course led to admire peacable lawgivers Numa, Solon & Lycurgus more than Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind \u2014 perhaps if my first ", "introduction to humanity humanity ", " had been ", "made by", " a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter I should have been imbued with different sensations. But Paradise Lost Excited different and far deeper emotions \u2013I read it as I had ", "read", " the other volumes which had fallen in to my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe. that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting \u2013 I often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own. Like Adam I was created apparently as I had been united by no link to any other being ", "in existence", " but his state was different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature happy prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator. \u2013he was allowed to converse & acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature\u2013 but I was wretched helpless and alone. Many times I considered Satan as my fitter mate for often like him when I viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me. Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress ", "which", " I had taken from your study. At first I", " had", " neglected them but now that I was able to decypher which they were written I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceeded my creation. you minutely described in ", "these papers", " every step you took in the progress of your work; this ", "history", " was mingled with accounts of domestic occurences. You doubtless recollect these papers\u2013 He re they are \u2013 Everything is related in them", " which bears reference to my accursed origin. the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious & loathsome person. is given in language which painted your own horrors, & has rendered mine ineffaceable.", ". I sickened as I read \u2013 Hateful day when I received life, I exclaimed in agony\u2014 Cursed Creator Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust. God in pity made man beautiful & alluring \u2013 I am more hateful to the sight than the bitter apples of Hell to the taste Satan has his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him. but I am solitary & detested. These were my reflections in my hours of despondency & solitude but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers. Their amiable & benevolent dispositions I persuaded myself that When they ", "should", " be came acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would pity me and overlook my personal deformity Could they turn from their door one however monstrous, who solicited their compassion & friendship? I resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to it", " 's success", " inspired me with a dread", " lest it should not succeed", ". Besides I found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience  that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking untill a few more months should have added to my wisdom. Several changes in the mean time took place in the cottage the presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there \u2013 Felix & and Agatha spent more time in amusement & conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants They did not appear rich but they were contented & happy. their feelings ", "were serene & peaceful,", " while ", "mine", " became every day more miserable \u2013 encrease of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope it is true but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or even my shadow in the moonshine \u2014I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of Paradise & dared to fancy amiable & lovely beings sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom \u2014 Their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation \u2014 But it was all a dream \u2013 No Eve soothed my sorrows or shared my thoughts. I was alone. I remembered Adams supplication to his creator but where was mine? He had abbandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him. Autumn passed thus with surpise & grief I saw the leaves decay & fall, And nature again assume the barren & bleak appearance it had when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. I did not heed the bleakness of the weather I was more fitted By my constitution for this sufferance of cold than heat. But my only joys were were the sight of flowers and birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me  I turned with more attention towards the cottagers Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer \u2013 They loved and sympathized with one another and their joys depending on each other were not ", "interrupted", " by the casualties that took place around them \u2014 The more I saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection & kindness. My heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me in kindness \u2013 I dared not think that they would turn ", "them", " from me with disdain or horror \u2013 The poor that stopt at their door were never driven away \u2013 I asked it is true for greater treasures that a little food or rest I required kindness & sympathy but I did not believe my self utterly unworthy of it The winter advanced and and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.\u2013  My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects but that on which I finally fixed was to enter their dwelling when the blind old man ", "should be", " alone.  I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me:\u2013my voice although harsh, had nothing terrible in it. I thought therefore that if in the absence of his children I could gain the goodwill of the old De Lacey I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.  One day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground, and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth Safie Agatha and Felix set out on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed he took up his guitar & played several mournful but sweet airs:", " more sweet & mournful that I had ever", " heard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thought fullness and sadness succeeded and laying down the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection. My heart beat quick. This was the hour & moment of trial which would decide my hopes The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair:\u2013 All was silent in and around the cottage It was an excellent opportunity yet when I ", "proceeded", " to execute my plan my limbs failed me, and I sunk to the ground. Again I rose and exerting all of the firmness of which I was master removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat \u2013 The fresh air revived me and with renewed determination I approached the door of the cottage. I knocked \u2013 \"who is there?\" said the old man\u2013 \"come in\"\u2014 I entered \u2013 \"Pardon this intrusion\" said I\u2013 \"I am a traveller, in want of a little rest. you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before your fire.\" \"Enter\" said De Lacey & I will try in what manner I can relieve your wants\u2013 but unfortunately my children are ", "from home,", " and as I am blind I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you\"\u2013 \"Do not trouble yourself, my kind host,\" I replied, I have food, it is warmth and rest only that I need.\u2013I sat down and a silence ensued; I knew very well that every minute was precious to me yet I remained irresolute in what manner to comemmence the interview when the old man addressed me \u2013\"By your language Stranger, I suppose you are my countryman, are you french?\" \"No,\" replied I but I was educated by a french family and understand that language only.  I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love and of whose favour I have some hopes.\" \"Are these Germans\"\u2013 Asked De Lacey \u2013 \"No \u2013They are french \u2013But let us change the subject \u2013I am an unfortunate & deserted creature. I look around and I have no relation or friend on earth \u2013 These amiable people to whom I go, have never seem me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.\" Do not despair, said the old man. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate: but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by obvious self interrest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely therefore on your hopes and if  these friends are good and amiable \u2013 do not despair They are kind\u2013 I answered\u2013 They are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions \u2013I love virtue and knowledge, \u2013my life has been hitherto harmless & in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.\u2013. That is indeed unfortunate, replied De Lacey\u2013 but if you are really blameless can not you undeceive them?  I am about to undertake that task \u2014 \"And it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors\u2014I love these friends tenderly;  I have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them, but they believe that I wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which I wish to over come. Where do these friends reside, said de Lacey \u2014 Near here. ", "on", " this spot. The old man paused a moment and then continued If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is somthing in your words ", "which", " persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way service able to a ", "human", " creature.\u2014. Excellent man \u2013 exclaimed I, I thank you and accept your generous offer You raise me from the dust by this kindess and I trust that I shall not be driven from the society & sympathy of my fellow creatures. Heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue \u2014I also am unfortunate.\u2013 I and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if I do not feel for your misfortunes\u2014. How can I thank you, my best & only benefactor \u2013 from your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me \u2013I shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with the friends whom I am on the point of meeting. May I know the names and residence of those friends? asked De Lacey. I paused \u2014 This was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever \u2013 I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him \u2013 the effort destroyed all my remaining strength I sank on a chair & sobbed aloud At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors\u2014I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man I cried\u2013 Now is the time, save and protect me You and your family are the friends whom I seek \u2013 Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!.\u2013. Great God! exclaimed the old man \u2013 Who are you? At that instant the cottage door opened and Felix, Safie and Agatha entered \u2013 Who can describe their horror and astonishment on beholding me \u2013Agatha fainted & Safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage.\u2013 Felix darted forward and with supernatural strength tore me from his father to whose knees I clung \u2013In a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me voi lently with a stick I saw him on the point of repeating the blow when overcome by pain and anguish I quitted the cottage and in the general tumult, escaped unperceived to my hovel. Cursed, Cursed Creator! Why did I live why in that instant did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not\u2014 Despair had not yet taken possession of me  my feelings were those of rage & revenge \u2013I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, and glutted myself with their shrieks & misery.  When night came on I quitted my retreat and wandered to the wood.\u2014 No longer restrained by the fear of discovery I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast in the toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with stag like swiftness.\u2014 Oh! What a miserable night I passed. the cold stars shone in mockery, the bare trees waved their branches above me and now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth anidst the universal stillness.\u2013 All save I were at rest or in enjoyment I like the arch fiend bore a hell within me and, finding myself unsympathized with, I wished to tear up the trees, spread havock and destruction and then have sat down & enjoyed the ruin\u2013. But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion; and sank on the damp grass in the despondency of despair. There was no one among the myriads of men that existed that would pity or assist me \u2014 and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No! from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against h", "im", " who had formed me & sent me forth to ", "this insupportable", " misery. The sun rose \u2013 I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat", " during ", "that day; accordingly, I hid myself in some thick underwood determin", "ing", " to devote the ensueing hours to reflection on my situation\u2014 The pleasant sunshine and pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity & When I considered what had passed at the cottage I could not help believing that I was too hasty in my conclusions \u2013 I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation", " h", "ad softened the father and I was a fool ", "for ", "having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me and by degrees have discovered myself to the rest of the family when they should have been prepared for my approach \u2013 But I did not believe my errors irretrievable \u2013 and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage \u2014 seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party.\u2014. These thoughts calmed me & in the afternoon I sunk into a profound sleep\u2013 but the fever of my blood did not allow of peaceful dreams the hor ri", " ble", " scene of the preceeding day was for ever acting before my eyes \u2013 The females were flying and the eraged Felix tearing me from his fathers feet\u2013 I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night I crept from my hiding place & went in search of food. When my hunger was appeased I directed my steps towards the well known path that conducted to the cottage \u2013 All there, was at peace \u2013 I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That ", "hour", " past, and the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear \u2013 I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark & I heard no motion. I cannot describe the agony I felt during this suspense. Presently two countrymen past by but pausing near the cottage they enterred into conversation using violent gestures I did not understand what they said for their language differred from that of my protectors \u2013 Soon After, however, Felix approached with another man I was surprised as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover by his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances. \"Do you consider, \"said his companion to him \u2014 that you \"will be obliged to pay three months rent \"& to lose the produce of your garden. \" I do not with to take any unfair advantage and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination. It is utterly useless\u2013 replied Felix, we can never again inhabit that cottage \u2013The life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstanc that I have related\u2014 My wife and sister will never recover their horror\u2014 I entreat you not to reason with me any more\u2014 Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place \u2013 Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes & then departed. I never again saw any of the family of de Lacey.", " more. ", "I continued in my hovel for the remainder of the day in a state of utter & stupid despair\u2013 my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world\u2013 for the first time the feeling of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to controul them \u2014 but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream I bent my mind towards injury & death\u2013 when I thought of my friends\u2013 of the mild voice of De Lacey the gentle eyes of Agatha \u2013 and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian \u2014 these thoughts vanish", "ed", " & a gush of tears somewhat soothed me\u2014But again when I reflected that they had spurned & deserted me, anger returned and unable to injure anything human I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.\u2013 As night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden \u2014  I waited with forced patience untill the moon had sunk to commence my operations. As the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens\u2014 Like a mighty avelanche the blast tore a long and produced in my spirits a kind of insanity that burst all bounds of reason or reflection \u2014 I lighted a dry branch of tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. part of it orb was at length hid and I waved my brand \u2014 it sunk and with a loud scream I fird the straw and hay that I had collected. The wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked ", "& destroying", " tongues, . As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the wood. And now with the world before me whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes \u2013 ", "But", " to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.\u2013 At length the thought of you crossed my mind \u2014 I learned from your papers that you were my creator & to whom could I apply with more fitness than to h", "im", " who had given me life. Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed on Safie geography had not been ommitted. From these I had learned the relative situations of the different countries of the earth; You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town & to wards this place I resolved to proceed. But how was I to direct myself?\u2014 I knew that I must travel in a South west", "erly direction", " to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide \u2013 I did not know the names of the towns I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being \u2013 But I did not despair From you only could I hope for succour although towards you I felt ", "no", " sentiment", " that that of hate.", " \u2013 Unfeeling heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroard for the scorn & horror of mankind \u2014 But on you only had I any claim & from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from ", "any other being that wore the human form. ", ". My travels were long and the suffering", "s", " I endured intense \u2013It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided \u2013  I travelled only at night, fearful of meeting the visage of a human being.\u2014Nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless,\u2014rain & snow poured around me and I found no shelter \u2014 Oh Earth how often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being\u2014 The mildness of my nature had fled & all within me was turned to gall & bitterness \u2013  the nearer I approached to your habitation the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge ", "become kind led in", " my heart\u2014 Snow fell around me and the waters were hardened, but I rested not\u2014A few incidents now and then directed me right but I often wandered wide from my path. ", "The agony of my grief allowed me no respite, No incident occurred from which my rage & misery could not extract its food. but a circumstance", " that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland \u2014 when the sun had recovered a part of its heat & the earth again began to look green confirmed in a", "n especial", " manner the bitterness & horror of my feelings. I generally rested ", "during", " the day, and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen . The day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sun", "shine", " & the gentleness of the breeze. \u2013 I felt emotions of softness and pleasure that had long appeared dead, revive within me; half surprized with these new sensations I allowed myself to be borne away by them & forgetting my solitude & deformity dared to be happy tears of gentleness again bedewed my cheeks and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfullness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me. I continued to wind among the paths of the wood untill I came to its boundary which was skirted a deep & rapid river \u2014 into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring.\u2013 Here I paused, not exactly knowing what course to pursue when I heard voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came run ning towards the spot where I was concealed \u2013 laughing as if she had ran from some one in sport \u2013 She continued her course along the precipitate sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipt, & she fell in to the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding place and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her, & dragged her to shore \u2014 She was senseless and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore", " animation", " when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled \u2013 On seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the forest \u2014  I followed speedily I hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried, at my body & fired. I sunk to the ground & with encreased swiftness He escaped into the wood. This then was the reward of my benevolence I  had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompence I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh & bone &  The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage & gnashing of teeth \u2013 inflamed by pain I vowed eternal hatred & vengeance to all mankind \u2014 But the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and I fainted. For some weeks I led a miserable life in these woods endeavouring to cure the wound ", "which", " I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through\u2014at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My suffering were augmented also by the oppressive sense of ", "the", " injustice & ingratitude ", "of their infliction", " My daily ", "vows", " rose for revenge \u2013 a deep & deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the", " the outrages & the anguish I had endured. ", "After some weeks my wound healed and I continued my journey \u2014 the labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring \u2014all joy was but ", "a", " mockery to me,  which insulted my desolate state, & made me feel more painfully that I was not made for enjoyment. But my toils now drew near a close & two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva. The same chapter continued. It was evening when I arrived in the outskirts of that town and I retired to a hiding place among the fields that surround it, to consider in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of the Jura. At this time a slight sleep relieved me which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy\u2014Suddenly as I gazed on him an idea seized me \u2013 that this little creature was unprejudiced & had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If therefore I could seize him & educate him as my companion & friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. Urged by this impulse I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form he placed his hand before his eyes & uttered a shrill scream. I drew his hand forcibly from his face & said Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you\u2014 listen to me. He struggled violently Let me go he cried\u2014 Monster \u2014 ugly wretch You wish to eat me & tear me to pieces you are an ogre, \u2013 let me go or I will tell my papa. Boy said I \u2013 You will never see your father again \u2013you must come with me. He burst into loud cries \u2014 hideous monster let me go \u2014 My papa is a syndic he is M. Frankenstien let me go you dare not keep me. Frankenstein cried I \u2014 You belong then to my enemy\u2013To him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge & you shall be my first victim. The child still struggled & loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart \u2013 I grasped his throat to silence him & in a moment he lay dead at my feet. I gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph \u2014 clapping my hands I exclaimed I ", "too", " can ", "make desolate.", " \u2013 My enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair to him & a thousand thousand others miseries shall torment & destroy him. As I fixed my eyes on the child I saw something glittering on his breast \u2013 I took it I was the portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me. for a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark ", "deep", " eyes & lovely lips but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights such beautiful creatures could bestow \u2013 and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me have, changed that air of divine benignity to one of horror & detestation. Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in useless exclamations & agony I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them. While I was overcome by these feelings I left the spot where I had committed the murder and sought a more secluded hiding place. At that moment I peceiv ing a woman passing near me,\u2013 she was young; not indeed so beautiful as her who portrait I held but of an agreable aspect & blooming in the loveliness of health & youth. And here I thought is one of those whose smiles are bestowed on all but me She shall not escape my vengeance thanks to the lessons of Felix & the sanguinary laws of man, I ", "have learned", " how to work mischief. I approached her unpeceived, and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. For some day I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world & it miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains and have ranged", " through ", "their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify\u2014And we may not part untill you have promised to comply with my requisitions. I am alone & miserable. Man will not associate with but one as deformed and horrible as my self would not deny herself to me. This being you must create. The creature finished speaking and fixed his", " looks", " on me in expectation of a", " reply.", " But I was bewildered & perplexed & unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the meaning of his proposition. He continued. You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being; This you alone can do & I demand of you as a right which you must not refuse. As he said this I could no longer suppress the anger that burned within me. I do refuse it, I replied, & no torture shall ever extort a consent from me \u2013 You may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself whose joint wickedness would desolate the world? Begone \u2013I have answered you \u2013 You may kill me but I will never consent. You are in the wrong, replied he, & instead of threatening I am content to reason with you. I am malicious, because I am miserable. Am I not shunned & hated by all mankind? You my creator would tear me to pieces & triumph \u2013Remember that & tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me. You would not call it murder if you precipitated me into one of those ice rifts & destroyed my frame, the work of your ", "own", " hands. shall I respect man when he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit ", "upon him", " with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. But mine shall not the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries if I cannot inspire love I will cause fear and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy because my creator; do I swear ", "inextinguishable", " hatred\u2013 I will work & destroy nor finish untill I desolate your heart so that you curse the hour of your birth.\" A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself, & proceeded. I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the ", "sole", " cause ", "of its excesses.", ". If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me I should return then an hundred & a hundred fold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind\u2013 But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate. I demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself. The gratification is small but it is all that I can receive and it shall content me. It is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another Our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless & free from ", "the", " misery", " which", " I now feel. Oh! my creator make me happy\u2013, let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit; Let me see that I excite the sympathy of one creature. Do not deny me my request. I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did not I as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling & continued. If you consent neither you or any human creature shall ever see us again. I will go to the vast wilds of America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb or the kid to glut my appetite. Acorns & berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man & will ripen our food. You are moved. The picture I present to you is peaceful & human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantoness of power & cruelty. Pitiless as you are towards me I see compassion in your eyes. Let me seize the favourable moment & persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire. You promise, replied I, to quit the habitations of man and to inhabit those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you who long for the love & sympathy of man persevere in this exile? You will return and seek their kindness & you will meet their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, & you will then have a companion to aid you in your task of destruction. Begone; I cannot consent. The Monster replied with fervour, How inconstant are your feelings; but a moment ago you were moved by my representations, & why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear by the earth which I inhabit & by you that made me that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man & dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy. My life will flow quietly away & in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker. His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him & sometimes felt a wish to console him but when I looked on him when I saw the filthy mass that moved & talked my heart sickend & my feelings were altered to those horror & hatred. I tried to stifle them I thought that as I could not sympathize with him I had no right to refuse him the small portion of happiness that I had it in my power to bestow. You swear, I said, to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malise that would reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will encrease your triumph", " by affording a wider scope to your revenge. ", "How is this, cried he; I thought I had moved your compassion, and yet you still refuse to bestow on me the only benefit that ", "can", " soften my heart and render me harmless. If I have no ties & no affections hatred & vice must be my portion. The love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes & I shall become a thing of whose existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when I ", "shall", " receive the sympathy of an equal. I shall feel ", "the", " affections ", "of a living being", " & become linked to the chain of existence & events from which I am now excluded. I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had ", "employed", ". I thought of  the ", "promise of", " virtues ", "which", " he had displayed on the opening of his existence; and the subsequent blight ", "of all kindly feelings by", " the detestation & horror ", "inspired by", " protectors had manifested towards him. His power & threats were not ommitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist among the ice caves of the glaciers & hide himself from per suit in the ridges inaccessible precepieces was was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with; After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him & my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him therefore I said. I consent to your demand on you solemn oath to quit Europe & every other place in the neighbourhood of mam as soon as I shall deliver into you hands a female who is to accompany you in your exile. I swear, he cried, by the sun & by the blue sky of heaven that while they exist you shall never behold me. Depart then to your home & commence your labours. I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready for me ", "that", " I shall appear. Saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of the eagle and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of ice. His tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten to descend to the valley as I should soon be encompassed in darkness. But my heart was heavy, and mys steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced teazed me occupied as I was by the feelings ", "which", " the occurences of the day had produced. It had long been night when I came to the half way resting place & seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them \u2014 The dark pines rose before me & every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity &  stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony I exclaimed\u2013 Oh stars, & clouds, and wind ye are all about to mock me \u2014 If ye really pity crush me but if not depart depart & leave ", "me", " to darkness. These were wild & miserable thoughts but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of stars weighed upon me, and I listened to every blast of wind as it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. It was morning before I arrived at the village of Chamounix \u2014 but my presence so haggard & strange hardly calmed the fears of my family who had waited the whole night in anxious expectation of my return. The following day we returned to Geneva. The intention of my father in coming had been to divert my mind & to restore to me my lost tranquillity. But the medecine had been fatal & unable to account for the excess of misery I appeared to suffer he hastened to return home hoping that the quiet & calm of a domestic life would by degrees alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring. For myself I was passive in all their arrangements, and the gentle affection of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to draw me from the depth of my despair. The promise I had made to the d\u00e6mon weighed upon my mind like Dante's iron cowl on the head of the hellish hypocrites. all pleasures of earth or sky passed before me as a dream & that one thought only had to me the reality of life. Can ou wonder that sometimes a kind of insanity possessed me or that I saw about me a multitude of filthy animals inflicting on me incessant torture that often extorted screams & bitter groans. By degrees however these feelings became calmed. I entered again into the every day of life if not with interrest at least with some degree of tranquillity. Day after day, week after week passed away on my return to Geneva and I had not the courage to commence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet I ", "I was unable to", " overcome my repugnance ", "to the task", ".  I found also that I was unable to compose a female without again devoting several months to study & laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and I etimes thought of obtainting my fathers consent to visit England for this purpose but I clung to ", "every", " pretence of delay & could not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity My health which had hitherto declined was now much restored, & my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy\u2013 which every now and then would return by fits & with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude: I passed whole days on the lake Alone in a little boat watching the clouds & ", "listening to", " the ripp", "ling", " of the waves, silent & listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed ", "to", " restore me to some degree of composure & on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile, & ", "a", " more cheerful heart. It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me. I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures & seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy & still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded I conjure you to avow it secresy on such a point would ", "not only", " be useless ", "but draw but", " down treble misery on us all. I trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued. I confess my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with your cousin as the tie of our domestic comfort & the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; ou studied together and appeared in dispositions & tastes entirely suited for one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it, you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay you may have met with another whom you may love ^", "and", " considering yourself as bound in honor to your cousin, this feeling may occasion the poignant misery ", "which", " you appear to feel. My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly & sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited as Elizabeth does my warmest admiration & affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.\u2014 The expression of your sentiments, on this subject my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken too strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that every day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility", " that ", "you may have formed. Do not suppose however that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any ", "serious", " uneasiness; Interp e et my words with candour and answer me I conjure you with confidence and sincerity. I listened to my father in silence and remained for sometime without offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to come to some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fufilled and dared not break; or if I did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground. ", "I must", " perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union, ", "from which I expected", ". I remembered also the necessity I was under of either ", "journeying", " to England or entering into a long correspondence with the", " philosophers", " of that country whose knowledge and discoveries ", "were of", " be of ", "indispensable", " use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides any change of scene was agreable to me and I was delighted with the idea of spending a year or two ", "in change of scene & variety of occupation in absence from my family", " during which time  some event might happen which would restore me to them in peace and happiness. My promise might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed or some accident might occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever\u2014These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England but concealing ", "the", " true reasons ", "of this", " request I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the walls of my native town. I urged my ", "entreaty", " with earnestness and my father was easily induced to comply; for a  more indulgent ", "or a", " less dictatorial parent did not exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh where Clerval would join me and we should proceed down the Rhine together. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland but our principal stay would be in England. We should return by France \u2013 & it was agreed that this tour should occu py the space of two years. My father pleased himself with the reflection that I should be united to Elizabeth immediately on my return to Geneva. These two years, said he, will pass swiftly and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness. And indeed I earnestly desire that period to arrive when we shall all be united and neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm. I am content, I replied with your arrangement. By that time we shall both have become wiser and I hope happier than we at present are I sighed but my father kindly forbore question me ", "further", " concerning the cause of my dejection\u2013 He hoped that new scenes and the amusement of travelling would restore my tranquillity. I now ", "made arrangements", " for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go and would he not accompany me to England? This ", "imagination", " was dreadful in itself but soothing in as much as ", "it supposed the safety of", " my friends . I was agonized with the ", "idea of a", " possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be govern by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and ", "exempt", " my ", "family", " from the danger ", "of his machinations", ". It was in the latter end of August that I departed to pass two years of exile. Elizabeth approved of the reasons of my departure and only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her experience & cultivating her understanding \u2013She wept however as she bade me farewell and entreated to return happy & tranquil. We all, said she, depend upon you, & if you are miserable what must be our feelings? I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither I was going & carless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. For I resolved to fulfil my promise while abroard & return if possible a free man. Filled with dreary imaginations I passed through many beautiful & majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed & unobserving; I could only think of the bourne of my travels & the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured. After some days spent in listless indolence during which I traversed many leagues I arrived at Strasburgh where I waited two days for Clerval. He came; alas, how great was the contrast between us. He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he saw it rise & recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape & the appearances of the sky. \"This is what it is to live, he cried, now I enjoy existence. But you, my dear Frankenstein, ", "wherefore are you", " desponding & sorrowful?\" Indeed I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine; and you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling & delight, than to listen to my reflections; I, a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment. We had agreed to go down the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourgh to Rotterdam whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed by many willowy islands & saw several beautiful towns. We staid a day at Manheim, ", "&", " on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of preci pieces  surrounded by black woods high & inaccessible. This part of the Rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated lanscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipieces with the dark Rhine rushing beneath. And on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards & populous towns with green sloping banks & a meandering river occupy the scene. We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, & my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings; even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations who can describe those of Henry. He felt as if he had been transported to fairy land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes of my own country. I have been on the lakes of Lucerne & Uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black & impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy & mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance. I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on the great ocean\u2013and the waves dash with fury ", "on", " the of the mountain where the priest & his mistress were overwhelmed by an avelanche, & where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the night wind. I have seen the mountains of la Valais & the pays de Vaud; But this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The Mountains of Switzerland are more majestic & strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs", " yon", " precipiece; and that also on the island almost concealed among the foliage of those lovely trees\u2013and now that group of laboures coming from among their vines; & that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh Surely the spirit that inhabits & guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country. I smiled at the enthusiasm of my friend and remembered with a sigh the period when my eyes would have glistened with joy to behold the scenes ", "which", " I now viewed. But the recollection of those days was too painful; I must shut out all thought to enjoy tranquillity, & that reflection alone is sufficient to poison every pleasure. At Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland & we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary & the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. We now arrived at very different country. The soil was sandy and the wheels sunk deep in it. The towns of this country are the most pleasing part of the scene. The Dutch are extremely neat but there is an awkwardness in their contrivances that often surprised us. In one place, I remember, a wind mill was situated in such a manner that the postillion was obliged to guide the carriage close to the opposite side of the road to escape from the sweep of its sails. The way often led between two canals where the road was only broard enough to allow one carriage to pass and when we met another vehicle which was frequently the case we were rolled back sometimes for nearly a mile untill we found one of the drawbridges which led to the fields, down on which one carriage remained while the other passed on. They soak their flax also in the mud of their canals and place it against the trees along the road side to dry. When the sun is hot the scent ", "which", " this exhales is not very easily endured. Yet the roads are excellent & the verdure beautiful. by sea to England. It was on a clear morning in the latter ", "days", " of September that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile & almost every town was marked by some story. We saw Tilbury Fort & remembered the Spanish Armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, Greenwich places which I had heard of even in my country. At length we saw the numerous steeples of London; St Pauls towerering above all & the Tower famed in English History. London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful & celebrated city. Clerval desired for the intercourse of the men of genius & talent who flourished at that time; but this was, with me, a secondary ", "object", "; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. If this journey had taken place during my days of study & happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence & I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which I was so deeply interrested. Company was irksome to me; when alone I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven & earth; the voice of Henry soothed me & I could cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninterresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrie placed between me & my fellow men; thi barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on those events filled my soul with anguish But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive & anxious to gain experience & instruction; The difference of manners ", "which", " he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of observation & amusement. He was for ever busy & the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful & dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much as possible that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him alledging another engagement that I might remain a alone; I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation & this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head; Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver & my heart to palpitate. After passing some months in London we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country & asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains & streams & all the wondrous works of nature in her chosen dwelling places We had arrived in Englan at the beginning of October and it was now february; we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh But to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock & the Cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed my chemical instruments & the materials which I had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the country. We quitted London on the 27 of March and remained a few days at Windsor rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; The majectic oaks the quantity of game & the  flocks of lovely deer were all novelties to us. From thence we proceeded to Oxford. We were charmed with the appearance of the town. The colledges are antient and picturesque, the streets broard & the landscape rendered perfect by the lovely Isis. which spreads into broard & placid expance of water & runs south of the town. We had letter s to several of the professors ", "who", " received ", "us", " with great politeness & cordiality. We found that the regulations of this university were much improved since the days of Gibbon; But there is still in fashion a great deal of bigotry & devotion to established rules that constrains the mind of the students & leads to slavish & narrow principles of action. Many enormities are also practised which although they might excite the laughter of a stranger were looked upon in the world of the university as matters of the utmost consequence. Some of the gentlemen obstinately wore light coloured pantaloons when it was the rule of the colledge to wear dark: the masters were angry & their scholars resolute so that ", "during our stay", " two of the students were on the point of being expelled on this very question. The threatened severity caused a considerable change in the costume of the gentlemen for several days. Such, to our infinite astonishment, we found to be the principal topic of conversation when we arrived in the town. Our minds had been filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted here above centur", "y", " s", "& a half", " before. It was here that Charles I had collected his forces; this town had been faithful to him when the whole nation had forsaken him to join the standard of parliament & liberty. It was strange to us ", "as we", " enter", "ed", " in the town our thoughts ", "were", " occupied by the memory the unfortunate king, the amiable Falkland and the insolent Gower ", "but we found", " it filled with gownsmen & students who think of nothing less than these events. Yet there are some relics to remind you of antient times; Among others we regarded with curiosity the press instituted by the author of the history of the troubles We re also shewn a room which Frier Bacon the disoverer of gunpowder had inhabited and which, as it was predicted, would fall in when a man wiser than that philosopher should enter it. A a short, round faced prating professor who accompanied us refused to pass the threshold; although we ventured inside in perfect . security ", "and probably he might have done the same. ", "Matlock, which was our next place of rest, resembled to agreat degree the scenery of Switzerland; But every thing is on a lower scale & the green ", "hills", " want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of our country. We visited the wondrous cave & the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox & Chamounix. The latter mame made me tremble when pronounced by Henry & I hastened to quit Matlock where the scenes were thus as cociated. From Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland & Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains; The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the north", "ern", " sides of the mountains \u2013 the lakes & the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar & dear sights to me. Here also we made some aquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent & he found in himself greater capacity & feeling than he could ^have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. \"I could pass my life here,\" said he to me, \"and among these mountains I should hardly regret Switzerland & the Rhine. But he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the strectch & when he begins to sink into repose hef inds himself obliged to quit it for something new which again engages his attention & which also ", "he", " forsakes for", " other", " novelt", "ies", ". We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland & Westmorland & conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached & we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time and I feared the effects of the d\u00e6moms disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland & wreack his vengeance of my relatives; this idea persued me & tormented me at every moment when I might otherwise have snatched repose & peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; If they were delayed I was miserable & overcome by a thousand fears; & when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father I hardly dared to read & ascer tain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me & might remind me", " by", " murdering my companion; ", "When", " these thought", "s posessed me", " I would not quit Henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless but I had ", "indeed", " drawn down a horrible curse", " upon", " my head ", "as mortal as that of crime", ". I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes & mind & yet that city might have interrested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford for the antiquity of the", " latter", " city was pleasing to him. But the beauty & regularity of the new town ", "of Edinburgh", " delighted him; its environs are also the most beautiful in the world; Arthur's seat, St Bernards Well & the Pentland hills\u2013 But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. We left Edinburgh in a week passing through Cooper, St Andrews & Along the the banks of the Tay to Perth Where our friend expected us; But I was not in the mood to laugh & talk with Strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland ", "alone", ". Do you, said I, enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous\u2013 I may be absent a month or two, but do not interfere with my motions I entreat you; leave me to peace & solitude for a short time & when I return I hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper.\" Henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ", "ceased to remonstrate. he", " entreated me to write often. I had rather be with you, he said, In your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom I do not know; hasten then my dear friend to return that I may again feel myself somewhat at home which I cannot do in your absence. Having parted from my friend I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me, and would discover himself", " to me, ", "when I should have finished, ", "that he might ", "receive his companion. With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the Orkney Islands for the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work; being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves\u2013 The soil was barren hardly affording pasture for a few miserable cows & oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five person", "s", ", Whose gaunt & scraggy limbs gave tokens of their sorry fare.  Vegetables & bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, & even fresh water was to be procured from the main land which was about five miles distant. On the whole island there were but three miserable huts & one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired\u2013 It contained but two rooms & these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury\u2014 The thatch had fallen in \u2013 the walls ", "were", " unplastered & the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture & took possession \u2013 an incident which would have doubtless occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty; as it was I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. In this retreat I devoted the mor ning to labour, but in the evening, when the weather permitted I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared & dashed at my feet; It was a monotonous yet ever changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; It was far different from this desolate & appalling landscape \u2013Its hills are covered with vines & its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains\u2014 Its fair lakes reflect a blue & gentle sky & when troubled by the winds it is but the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but as I proceeded in my work it became every day more horrible & irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times I ", "toiled", " day & night in order to ", "complete", " it. It was indeed a filthy work in which I was engaged. During my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy ", "had", " blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the sequel of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. Thus situated; employed in the most detestable occupation, in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits were unequal, I became restless & nervous\u2013 Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should meet", " the object which", " I so much dreaded to ", "behold", " I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone He should come to claim his companion. In the mean time I worked on & my labour was already considerably advanced\u2013 I looked with pleasure towards ", "its", " completion yet freedom from the curse I endured was a joy I never dared promise myself\u2014. One evening I sat in my workshop, the sun had set & the moon was just rising from the sea \u2014 I had not light sufficient for my employment and I sat idle in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led to me consider the effects of what I was now doing. three years before I had been engaged in the same manner & had created a fiend whose unparralelled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant. She might be ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight in murder & wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man & hide himself in desarts but she had not & she who was in all probability to become a thinking & reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate one another. The creature who already lived loathed his own deformity & might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form. She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man . She might quit him and he be again alone ", "exasperated by ", "the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to leave Europe & inhabit the desarts of the new world, it was their intention to have children and a race of devils would be propagated", " up", " on the earth from whose form & mind man shrunk with horro", "r", ". had I ", "any", " right for my own benefit to inflict this curse to everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being whom I had created; I had been moved by his fiendish threats & now for the first time the wickedness  of my promise burst upon me; I shud ered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the ", "existence of", " whole human race. I trembled, and my heart failed within me, when on looking up I saw by the light of the moon, the d\u00e6mon ", "at the casement.", " A ghastly grin wrinkled lips, ", "as he", " gazed on me ", "where", " I sat. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide & desart heaths & he now came to view my progress & claim the fulfillment of my promise; as I looked on him his countenance appeared to express the utmost extent of malice & ", "treachery.", " I thought with a sensation of madness ", "on", " my promise of creating another like to him & trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged \u2013 The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair ", "& revenge", " withdrew. I left the room & locking the door made a vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; & then with trembling steps I sought my own appartment I was alone. None were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the most terrible reveries. Several hours passed and I remained near my window gazing on the sea. It was almost motionless for the winds were hushed & all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon A few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now & then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of the voices as the ", "fisher", "men called to one another. I felt the silence although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity untill my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house. In a few minutes after I heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine. But I was overcome by the sensation", " of ", "helplessness so often felt in a frightful dream when you in vain endeavour to fly the impending danger & was rooted to the spot. Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage,", " the", " door opened & the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door he approached me & said in a smothered voice:\u2014 You have destroyed the work that you began; What is it that you intend? Do you dare break your promise? I have endured toil & misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and ", "over", " the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England & among the desarts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue & cold & hunger do you dare destroy my hopes? Begone, I replied; I do break my promise; never will create another like yourself, equal in deformity & wickedness. Slave, said the wretch, I before reasoned with you \u2013 but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator but I am your master; obey! Wretch, said I, the hour of my weakness is past & the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a resolution of not creating you companion in vice. Shall I in cold blood set loose upon the earth a d\u00e6mon whose delight is in death & wretchedness. Begone, I am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage. The Monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. Shall each man, cried he, find his equal, & each beast have his mate and I be alone. I had feelings of affection & they were returned by detestation. Man you may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread & misery and soon the bolt will fall which will ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness. You ", "can blast", " my other passions but revenge remains; revenge dearer than light or food. I may die but first you my tyrant & tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fearless & therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict. Devil, I cried, Cease, & do not poison the air with those sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you and I am no coward to bend beneath words \u2013 Leave me, I am inexorable. It is well, said he, I go; but remember! I shall be with you on your marriage night. I started forward & exclaimed\u2014Villain, before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe. I would have seized him but he eluded me and quitting the house with precipitation in a few moments I saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness & was soon lost amidst the waves. All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears; I burnt with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace & precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up & down my room hastily & perturbed, my imagination conjured before me a thousand images to torment & sting me \u2013 Why had I not followed him & closed with him in mortal strife\u2013? But I had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the main land; I shuddered to suppose who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge \u2013 And then again I thought of his words \u2013 \"I will be with you on your marriage night That then was the period fixed for the fulfillment of my destiny \u2013 In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.  The prospect did not not move me to fear yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth; of her tears & endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her \u2013tears the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes & I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle. The night passed away & the sun rose from the ocean \u2013 My feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me & my fellow creatures. Nay a wish that ", "such", " was the fact stole across me; I ", "wished that I", " might pass my life on this barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery \u2013If I returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those I most loved die under the grasp of a d\u00e6mon whom I had myself created. I walked about the isle like a restless spectre seperated from all it loved & miserable in the seperation When it became noon & the sun rose higher I lay down on the grass & was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceeding night, my nerves were agitated & my eyes inflamed with watching & misery. The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me & when I awoke I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself & I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure \u2014Yet still the words of the fiend rung in my ears like a death knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. The sun was far descended and I still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which was become ravenous with an oaten cake when I saw a fishing boat land close to me & one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva & one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that nearly a year had elapsed since we had quitted Switzerland and France was yet unvisited. He entreated me therefore to leave my solitary isle and meet him at Perth in a week from that time when we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This letter completely recalled me to life & I determined to quit my island . at the expiration of two days. Yet before I departed there was a task to perform on which I shuddered to reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments & for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, & I must handle the utensils the sight of which were sickening to me. The next morning at daybreak I summoned sufficient courage & unlocked the door of my work room \u2013 The remains of the half finished creature whom I had destroyed lay scattered on the floor \u2013 & I almost felt as if I ", "had", " mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself & then entered the chamber. With trembling hands I conveyed the instruments out of the room but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relicks of my work to excite the horror", " & suspicion ", "of the peasants and I accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and tying it up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the mean time I sat on the beach employed in cleaning & arranging my chemical apparatus. Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d\u00e6mon. I had before regarded my promise with gloomy despair as a thing that must with whatever consequences be fulfilled but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes & that I now for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for an instant occur to me. The threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine might avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest & most atrocious selfishness and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. Between two & three in the morning the moon rose and I then putting my basket into a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore \u2013 The scene was perfectly solitary, a few boats were returning towards land but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud & I took advantage of the moment of darkness & cast the basket into the sea \u2013 I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk & then sailed away from the spot. The sky had become clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the North-East breeze that was rising. But it refreshed & filled me with such agreable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water & fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure & I heard only the sound of the boat as it keel cut through the waves\u2013The sound lulled me\u2013& in a short time I slept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this situation but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably\u2013 The wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff\u2014 I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind \u2013 I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror \u2013I had no compass with me and was so little acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me \u2013I might be driven into the wide Atlantic & feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in immeasurable waters that roared & buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the tortures of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings \u2013 I looked on the heavens which was covered by clouds that flew with the wind only to be replaced by others\u2013 I looked on the sea \u2013 It was to be my grave. Fiend, I exclaimed, your task is already fulfilled\u2014I thought of Elizabeth of my father & of Clerval \u2013 & sunk into a reverie so despairing & frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever I shudder to reflect on it. Some hours passed thus\u2013But by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell, I felt sick & hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south. Almost spent as I was by fatigue & misery this sudden certainty of life rushed like a warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes. How mutable are our feelings & how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery.  I constructed another sail with apart of my dress & eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild rocky appearance but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation \u2013I saw vessels near the shore & found myself suddenly transported back to the neighborhood of civilized man \u2013 I eagerly ", "traced", " the windings of the ", "land", " & hailed a steeple which  I at length saw issueing from behind a small promontory \u2013 As I was in a state of extreme debility from fasting I resolved to go directly towards the town as a place where could most easily procure nourishment\u2013 Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I discovered a small neat town \u2013 and a good harbour which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. As I was occupied in fixing the boat and ar arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot \u2013 They appeared very much much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm \u2013as it was I merely remarked that it was English, that they spoke and therefore addressed them; My Good Friends, said I, Will you be so kind as to tell me what the name of this town is; & where I am. You will know that soon enough, replied a man with a gruff voice; May be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste \u2013 But you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you\u2014.  I was exceedingly surprized at receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions \u2013 Why do you answer me so roughly, I replied Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably. I do not know, said the man, what the custom of the English may be but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains. While this strange dialogue continued I perceived the croud rapidly encrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity & anger which annoyed & in so me degree alarmed me. I enquired the way to the inn but no one replied \u2013 I then moved foward and a murmuring noise rose from the croud as they followed & surrounded me\u2014 when an ill looking man comming forward\u2013 tapped me on the shoulder & said \u2013 Come, Sir, You must follow me to Mr. Kirwins to give an account of yourself. Who is Mr. Kirwin, said I, & why am I to give an account of myself.\u2013is not this a free country? Aye, Sir, replied the man, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate & you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night. This answer startled me, But I presently recovered myself. I was innocent & that could easily be proved \u2013 accordingly I followed my conductor in silence & was led to one of the best houses in ", "the", " town. I was ready to sink from fatigue & hunger, but bein", "g", " surrounded by a croud I thought it politic to rouse all my stren", "g", "th that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that would in a few moments overwhelm me, and ", "extinguish", " in horror & despair all fear of ignominy or death\u2014 I must pause ", "for it", " requires all my fortitude to recall ", "the", " frightful images ", "of the events which I am about to relate in", " in proper detail to my recollection. I was soon introduced into the presence of the Magistrate; an old benevolent man with calm & mild manners. He looked ", "upon", " me however with some degree of severity, and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son & his brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when about nine o clock they observed a strong northerly blast rising & they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen; They did not land at the harbour but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He went first carrying a part of the fishing tackle & his companions followed him at some distance. As he was walking along the sands he ", "struck", " his foot against somthing & fell all his length on the ground; his comrades came up to assist him & by the light of their lantern they discovered that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of ", "some person", " who had been drowned & thrown on shore by the waves, But upon examination they found that the clothes were not wet & even that the body was not yet cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near ", "the spot", " & endeavoured ", "but in vain", " to restore it to life . He appeared to have been a handsome young man about twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled for there", " was ", "no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck. The first ", "part", " of this deposition did not in the least interrest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother & felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled & a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support; the Magistrate observed me with a keen eye & of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner. The son confirmed his fathers account but when Daniel Nugent was questioned he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore & as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which I had just landed. A woman deposed that she lived near the beach & was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fisherman about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found. Another woman confirmed the account of the fisherman having brought the body into her house.\u2013It was not cold & they put it into a bed & rubbed it and Daniel went to the town for an appothecary, but life was quite gone. Several other men were examined concerning my landing & they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arrisen during the night it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours & have been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed, that it appeared I had brought the body from another place & it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore I might have put in to the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of \u2014\u2014 from the place where I had deposited the corpse. >M r. Kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it ", "would", " produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted by the Magistrate & several other persons to the Inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. I entered the room where the corpse lay & was led up to the coffin. How can I describle? my sensation. I feel yet parched with horror nor can I ever reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering & agony that faintly reminds of the anguish of ", "the", " recognition. The trial, the presence of the magistrate & witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me \u2013 I gasped for breath & throwing myself on the body I exclaimed. And have my murderous machi nations deprived you also my dearest Henry of life\u2014 Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destinny \u2013 But you, Clerval, my frend, my benefactor!\u2014. The human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that I endured & I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death. My ravings, as I afterwards heard were frightful. I called myself the murderer of William , of Justine & of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented \u2013 and at others I felt the fingers of the mosns ter already grasping my neck & screamed aloud with agony & terror. Fortunately as I spoke my native tongue Mr. Kirwin alone understood me. But my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient, to affright the other witnesses. Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before why did I not sink into rest & forgetfullness? Death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doating parents; How many brides & youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health & hope & the next a prey for worms & the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture. But I was doomed to live & in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gailors\u2013turnkeys, bolts & all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon It was morning I remember when I thus awoke I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened & only felt as if some great misery had overcome me. But when I looked around and saw the barred windows, & the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory \u2013& I groaned bitterly. This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys & her countenance expressed all those bad qua often characterize that class. her face was hard & rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her voice expressed her entire indifference \u2013 She addressed me in Eglish & the words struck me as one that I had heard during ", "my", " suffering", "s\u2013", " Are you better now, Sir, said she. I replied in the same language with a feeble voice; I believe I am but if it all be true \u2013 if indeed I did not dream I am sorry that I am still alive to feel misery & horror. For that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the gentleman that you murdered I believe that it were better for you if you were dead \u2013 for I fancy it will go hard with you, you will be hanged when the next session comes on \u2013 however that is none of my business I am sent to nurse you & get you well\u2013I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.\u2013. I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a", " person", " just saved on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed; ", "The whole series of my life", " appeared as a dream I sometimes doubted if indeed it was not all true but it never presented itself to my mind with the face of reality. As the images that floated before me became more distinct I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me no person was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came & prescribed medecines & the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first & the expression of brutality was strongly impressed on the visage of the second \u2013 who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee? These were my first reflections but I soon learned that Mr.. Kirwin had shewn me extreme kindness \u2013 He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me, (wretched indeed was the best) And it was he who had provided a physician & attendants for me. It is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer\u2014 He came therefore sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short & at long intervals. One day when I was gradually recovering ", "I was", " seated in a chair, my eyes half", " open,", " and my cheeks livid like those of death I was overcome by gloom & misery and often reflected whether I had better not seek death that wait miserably pent up only to be let loose in a world replete with ", "wretchedness.", " At one time I considered whether I should not delare myself guilty & suffer the penalty of the law which in depriving me of life would afford the only consolation that I was capable of receiving. Such were my thoughts when the door of my prison opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and kindness: he drew a chair close to mine & addressed me in french. I fear, , that this place is very shocking to you; Can I do anything to make you more comfortable. I thank you, replied I, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving. I know, that the sympathy of a stranger can be but little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune But you will I hope soon quit this unhappy abode\u2013 for doubtless evidence can be easily brought to free you from the criminal charge. That, is my least concern\u2013I am by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted & tortured as I am & have been can death beany evil to me? Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate & agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality Siezed immediately & charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed by some fiend as it were across your path\u2014 As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation that I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings\u2013I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was expressed in my countenance \u2013 for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say \u2013 It was not untill a day or two after your illness that I thought of examining your dress that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters among others one which I discovered by its commencement to be from your father \u2013 I instantly wrote to Geneva \u2013 nearly two months has passed since the departure of my letter \u2014But you are ill \u2013 even now you tremble", " You ", "appear unfit for agitation of any kind. This suspence, is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event \u2013Tell me what new scene of death has been acted & whose murder I am now to lament. Your family are all perfectly well, ", "said Mr. Kirwin", ", with gentleness; and some one, a friend, is come to visit you. I do not know by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the monster had come to mock at my misery & taunt me with the death of Clerval as a new incitement to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes & cried out in agony \u2013Oh! take him away \u2013 I cannot see him for Gods sake do not let him enter! Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt & said in rather severe tone \u2013 I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your Father would have been welcome instead of inpiring such violent repugnance. My father, said, I, while every feature & every muscle was relaxed from nguish to pleasure \u2013 Is my father indeed come \u2013 how kind, how very kind! But here is he, why does he not hasten to me? My change of manner suprised & pleased the magistrate, perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium ndnow he instantly resumed his former benevolence \u2013 He rose and quitted the room with my nurse & in a minute my father entered it. Nothing at this moment could have given my greater pleasure than the arrival of my father \u2013 I stretched out my hand to him & cried \u2013 Are you then safe & Elizabeth & Ernest. My father calmed me by his assurances of their welfare & told me that he had not communicated my imprisonment to my cousin but merely mentioned my illness\u2014And what a place this is that you inhabit, my son continued he looking mourn fully at the barred windows and the wretched appearance of the room; You travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you \u2013And poor Clerval. The name of my unfortunate & murdered friend was too great an agitation to be endured in my weak state\u2014I shed tears; Alas, yes, my father said I, ", "some", " destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over ", "me,", " and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry. We were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary ", "that could ensure tranquillity", ". Mr.. Kirwin came in & insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health. As my sickness quitted me I was absorbed by a gloomy & black melancholy that nothing could dissipate\u2013 The image of Clerval was for ever before me ghastly & murdered \u2013 More than once the agitation", " into which", " these reflections threw me into made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny which is drawing to a close\u2014 Soon Oh very soon will death extinguish these thro", "b", " bings ", "releive me from", " this mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts & I often sat for hours motionless & speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me & my destroyer in its ruins. The season of the assizes approached\u2013 I had already been three months in prison & although I was still weak & in continual danger of a relapse I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the county town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence\u2013 I was spared the disgrace of appearing publickly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the  court that decides on life & death\u2014 The Grand Jury rejected the bill on its being proved that I was in the rkney Island at the hour the body of my friend was found. And a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison\u2014My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge & that I was again permitted to breathe the fresh atmosphere & allowed to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful \u2013 The cup of life was poisoned for ever & although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy & gay of heart I saw around me nothing but a dense & frightful darkness penetrated by no glimmer but the light of two eyes that glared upon me.\u2013 Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry languishing in death \u2013 the dark orbs nearly covered by the lid & the long lashes that fringed it \u2013 Sometimes it was the watry clouded eyes of the monster as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt. My father tried to awake in me the feelings of affection \u2014 He talked of Geneva which I should soon visit \u2013 Of Elizabeth & Ernest But these words only drew from me deep groans \u2014 Sometimes indeed I felt a wish for happiness; my beloved cousin & the blue lake which had been so dear to me, in early childhood, but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature & these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxisms of anguish & despair \u2013 At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed & it required unceasing attendance & vigilance to ", "restrain me from", " committing some dreadful act of violence. I remember as I quitted the prison I heard one of the men say \u2013 He may be innocent of the murder but he has certainly a bad conscience.\u2013. These words struck me; a bad conscience, yes surely I had one \u2013 William, Justine & Clerval had died through my infernal machinations And whose death, cried I, is to finish the tragedy \u2014 Ah! my father do not let us remain in this wretched country\u2013 Take me where I can forget myself, my existence & all the world. My father easily acceeded to my desire & after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin we hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy weight when the packet set sail with a fair wind from Ireland and I had quitted for ever the country which had been to me the scene of so much misery \u2013 It was midnight, my father slept below in the cabin & I lay on the deck looking at the stars & listening to the dashing of the waves \u2013I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight & my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva The passed appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which I was \u2013 the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision & that Clerval my friend & dearest companion had fallen a victim to me & the monster of my creation. I repassed in my memory my whole life; my quiet happiness when residing with my family in Geneva \u2013The death of my Mother and my departure for Insgolstadt; I remembered with shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy & I called to my mind the night on which he first lived. I I was unable to ", "pursue", " the train of thought \u2013A thousand feelings pressed upon me & I wept bitterly.\u2014. Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. O pressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes I now took a double dose & soon slept profoundly. But alas sleep did not afford me respite from thought & misery \u2013 my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me\u2013 towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare \u2013 I felt the fiends grasp on my neck and could not free myself from it\u2014Groans & cries rung in my ears\u2013 My father who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness awoke me and pointed to the port of Holyhead which we were now entering. We had resolved not to go to London but to cross the country to Portsmouth and thence to embark to Havre. I preferred this plan principally because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval \u2013 And I thought with horror of seeing those men whom we had been accustomed to visit together and who, doubtless, would make enquiries concerning an event the very remembrance of which made me again feel what I endured when I gazed on his lifeless form. As for my father; his desires & exertions were bounded to the again seeing me restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness & attentions were unremitt", "ing", ", my grief and gloom was o bstinate but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. Alas! my father, said I, how little do you know me: human beings, their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine poor unhappy Justine was as innocent as I and she suffered the same charge, she died for it \u2013 And I am the cause of this \u2013 I murdered her. William Justine & Henry, they all died by my hand. My father had often during my late confinement heard me make the same ssertion . When ", "I thus", " ac accuse", " d", " myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation & at others he appeared to consider it as caused by delirium & that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembe rance of which I preserved in my convalescence. avoided explanation; I maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should be supposed mad and this for ever chained my tongue when I would have given the whole world to have confided the fatal secret. Up on th", "e", "s", "e", " occasion", "s", " my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder What do you mean, Victor, are you mad? My dear son, I entreat you not to make so strange an assertion again. I am not mad, I cried energetically, the sun & the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth. I was the assassin of those most innocent victims \u2014 they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives: But I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race. The conclusion of this speech persuaded my father that my ideas were deranged \u2013 and ", "by", " instantly chang", "ing", " the subject of our conversation ", "he", " endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes in Ireland and never again alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes. As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart but I no longer talked in the ", "same", " incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which desired sometimes to declare itself to the whole world, & my manners were calmer & more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the Sea of Ice. Even my father who watched me as the bird does its nestling was deceived and thought that the black melancholy which had oppressed me was quitting me for ever and that my native country & the society of my friends would entirely restore me to my former health & vivacity. We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May & instantly proceeded to Paris where my father had some business which detained ", "us", " a few weeks.  In this city I received the following letter from Elizabeth: To Victor Fankenstein May 1 8 \u2013 17\u2014 My dearest Friend. It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my ncle dated at Paris. You are no longer at a formidable distance and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor Cousin! How much must you have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably but although happiness will not shine in our eyes for many months yet I hope to see peace in your countenance & to find that your heart is not totally devoid of comfort & tranquility. Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time. I would not at this period disturb you when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet. Explanation, you may possibly say, what can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this my questions are answered and I have no more to do than to sign myself your affectionate cousin. But you are distant from me &  it is possible that you may dread & yet be pleased with this explanation and in the probability of this being the case I dare not postpone any longer to write what during your absence I have often wished to express to to you but have never had courage to begin. You well know, ictor, that our union had been the favourite plan of my aunt and uncle ever since our infancy\u2013We were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood & I believe dear & valued friends to one another when we grew older. But as a brother & sister often entertain a lively affection towards one another ", "without desiring a more intimate union", " may not ", "such", " also be our case. Tell me, dearest Victor, nswer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth do you not love another? You have travelled, you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt\u2013& I confess to you, my friend that when I saw you last Autumn so unhappy flying from the society of every creature to solitude & despondency I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection & believe your self bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false resoning. I confess to you my cousin that I love you & that in my airy castles of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep when I think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word honor all hope of that love & happiness which would alone", " restore you to yourself.", " I who have so disinterrested an affection for you may encrease your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes Ah Victor be assured that your cousin & playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made wretched by this supposition. Be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request be assured that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity. Do not answer it tomorrow or the next day or not even untill you come if it will give you pain. My Uncle will send me news of your health and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this letter or any other exertion of mine I shall need no other happiness\u2013 Your affectionate friend Elizabeth Lavenza. Geneva This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of fiend when he visited me at the Orkney Island. I will be with you on your marriage night. Such was my sentence and on that night would the d\u00e6monem ploy every art to destroy me & tear me from the ", "glimse", " happiness ", "by which it promised", " partly console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well be it so. A deadly struggle would then assuredly take place where if he was victorious I should be at peace and his power over me ", "be", " at an end If he were vanquished  I should be a free man \u2014 Alas what a freedom such as peasant endures when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste & he is turned adrift homeless, pennyless & alone: but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure alas balanced by the horrors of remorse & guilt which would pursue me untill death. Sweet & beloved Elizabeth! I read & reread her letter & some softened feelings stole in to my heart & dared whisper Paradiscical dreams of love & joy\u2013 But the apple was already eaten & the ngels arm bared ready to chase me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy and if the monster executed his threat ", "death was inevitable.", " Yet again I considered ", "whether", " my marriage would hasten my fate if once the fiend had determined on my death \u2013 ", "My destruction might inded arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed my marriage on account of his menaces he would surely find other, & perhaps more dreadful means of revenge", ". He had vowed to be with me on my marriage night Yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the mean time \u2013 for as if to shew me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered Clerval ", "immediately after the enunciation of this theats", " \u2013 . I resolved ", "therefore", " that if my immediate union with my cousin sw ould conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversary's threats against my life should not retard it a single hour.\u2013.  In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate \u2013 I fear, my beloved girl, I said, little happiness remains on earth for us, yet ", "all that", " I may one day enjoy is concentered ", "in", " you. Chase away your idle fears \u2013To you alone do I consecrate my life & my endeavours for content. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one\u2014 It will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at at my misery you will only wonder that I live. I will reveal this tale of misery & terror to you the day after our marriage \u2013 for, my sweet cousin, we must have perfect confidence between us \u2013 But untill then I conjure you do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat of you & I know ", "that", " you will comply. In about a week after ", "the arrival of Elizabeths letter", " we returned to Geneva. Elizabeth welcomed me with warm affection \u2013 yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my ematiated frame & feverish ", "cheeks", ". I also saw a change in her\u2014She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me\u2013 But her softness & gentle looks of compassion made her more fit for one blasted & miserable as I was. The calm however which I now enjoyed did not last. Recollection brought madness with it\u2013 And when I thought of what ", "had", " passed a real insanity possessed me \u2013 Sometimes I was furious & burnt with rage sometimes low & des pondant I neither spoke or looked but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits \u2013 Her gentle voice would sooth when passionate and inspire with human feelings when sunk in torpor \u2013 She wept with me and for me. When reason returned she would remonstrate with me & endeavour to inspire me with resignation \u2014Ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned\u2013 But for the guilty there is no peace: the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there otherwise is ", "sometimes found", " in indulging the excess of grief. Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin. I remained silent. Have you then, said my father some other attachment. None on earth I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight\u2014Let the day therefore be named  and on it I will consecrate my life or death to the happiness of my cousin. My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we ha", "ve", " lost to those who ", "yet", " live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection & mutual misfortune\u2014 And when time will have", " softened", " your despair new & dear cares will be born to replace those", " of ", "whom ", "we have been so cruelly", " deprived . Such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words\u2013 I shall be with you on your marriage night I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it and I therefore with contented & even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that the ceremony should take place if my cousin would consent in ten days. and thus put, as I imagined the seal to my fate. Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary I would rather have banished myself for ever from my country ", "& wandered a friendless outcast over the earth", " than have consented to this miserable marriage \u2013 But as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real resolutions & when I thought I prepared only my own death I hastened that of ", "a far dearer", " victim. As the time drew nearer for our marriage, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink with in me \u2013 But I concealed ", "my feelings under", " an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles of joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the ever watchful & nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid content not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain & tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream & leave no trace but deep & everlasting regret. Preparations were made for the event. Congratulatory visits ", "were", " received and all wore a smiling appearance \u2013I shut up as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A house was purchased for us near Coligny by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country and yet be so near Geneva as to see my father every day\u2013 who would still reside within the walls for the benefit of Ernest, that he might follow his studies at the university. In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should at ack we\u2014 I carried pistols & a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice & by these means gained a great degree of tranquillity\u2013 And indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore an appearance of greater certainty as the period of its solemnization drew near and I heard it spoken of every day as an occurence which no accident could possibly prevent. Elizabeth seemed happy at the change from mirth to content which she saw come over me\u2013 But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes & my destiny she was melancholy\u2013 a presentiment of evil pervaded her & perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her the following day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only observed in the melancholy of his neice the diffidence of a bride. After the cermony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that Elizabeth & I should pass the afternoon & night at Evian and set out on our return the next morning. The day was fine and as the wind was favourable we resolved to go by water. Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot but we were sheltered by a kind of canopy from its rays while we enjoyed the beauty of scene \u2013 Sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw Mont Sal\u00eave \u2013 the pleasant banks of Montalegre and ata distance surmounting all the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that endeavoured to emulate her \u2014 Sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would wish to quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the conqueror that should dare invade it. I took the hand of Elizabeth \u2013 You are sorrowful, said I, ah my love, if you knew what I have suffered & what I may still endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet & freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy. Be happy, my dear Victor, replied Elizabeth \u2014 there is I hope nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is content. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect which is opened before us but I will not listen to such a sinister voice \u2013 Observe how fast we move along & how the clouds which sometimes obscure & sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc render this scene of beauty still more interresting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in these clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day; how happy & serene all nature appears! Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts & mine from all reflection on melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating. joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction & reverie. The sun sunk lower in the heavens we passed by the river Drance & observed its path through the chasm of the mountains & the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake & we approached the amphitheatre of mountains that forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it & the range of mountain above mountain ", "by", " which it ", "was", " overhung . The wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sunk at sunset to a gentle breeze \u2013 the light air just ruffled the water & caused a pleasant motion among the trees. As we approached the shore it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers & hay. The sun sunk beneath the horizon as we landed and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which ", "soon were to clasp me & cling to me forever.", " It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory twilight & then retired to the Inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, mountains & woods obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines\u2013 The wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west\u2014the moon had reached her summit in the heavens & was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the ", "scene of the  made", " still busier by the ", "restless", " waves that were beginning to rise\u2014 Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. I had been calm during the day but", " so soon", " as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind \u2013 I was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom \u2014Every sound terrified ", "me,", " but I resoldved that I would sell my life dearly & not ", "relax the conflict that impended", " untill ", "my own life, or that of my adversary were extinguished. ", "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid & fearful silence t length she said \u2014 What is it, my dear Victor, that agitates you? What is it you fear? Oh peace, peace, my love, I replied, this night and all will be safe \u2013 but this night is dreadful very dreadful. I passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly I reflected how dreadful the combat which I ", "momently", " expected ", "to", " take place would be to my wife and I earnestly entreated her to retire \u2013 resolving not to join her untill I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. She left me and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house & inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary \u2013 But I saw no trace ", "of him", " &", " was ", "beg", "inning", " to consider ", "that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menace,", " \u2013 When suddenly I heard a shrill & dreadful scream.\u2013 It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it the whole truth rushed to my mind my arms dropped \u2013 the motion of every muscle & fibre was suspended I could feel the blood trickling in my veins \u2013 ", "& tingling in my feet", " This state lasted but an instant the scream was repeated & I rushed into the room. Great God why did I not then expire \u2013 Why I am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope & ", "the", " purest creature of earth \u2013 She was there \u2013 lifeless & inanimate \u2013 thrown across the bed her head hanging down her pale & distorted features half covered by her hair \u2013 Every where I turn I see the same figure \u2014Her bloodless arms & relaxed figure flung by the murderer on its ", "bridal", " bier \u2014 Could I behold this & and live\u2013 Alas life is obstinate ", "it clings closest", " where it is most hated\u2013 for a moment only did I lose recollection \u2013 I fainted. When I recovered I found myself in the midst of the people of inn \u2013 Their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared ", "only as", " a mockery ", "a shadow", " of the feelings that oppressed", " me. ", "I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth \u2013 my love \u2014 my wife \u2013 so lately living \u2013 so dear \u2013so worthy \u2013 She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her & now as she lay her head upon her arm and a hankerchief thrown across her face & neck I might have supposed her asleep \u2013 I rushed towards her & embraced her with ardour but the deathly coldness of the body told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved & cherished, the murderous grasp of the fiend was on her neck & the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. While I still held her in my arms in the agony of despair I happened to look up. The room had before been quite dark and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous & abhorred \u2013 A grin was on the face of the monster. he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife\u2014I rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom \u2013shot\u2013 but ", "he", " eluded me \u2013 leapt from his station and running with ", "the", " swiftness of lightning plunged in to the lake. The report of my pistol brought a crowd into the room I pointed to where he had disappeared & we followed him with boats & cast nets but in vain and passing several hours in the search returned hopeless \u2013 Most of my companions believeing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. However after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods & vines. I did not accompany them I was exhausted; a film covered my eyes and my ", "s", "kin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened & my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek somthing that I had lost. At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return of Elizabeth & myself and that I must return alone. This reflection brought tears into my eyes & I wept for a long time. I reflected on my misfortunes & their cause and was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine the murder of Clerval & now of my wife \u2013 even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend \u2013 my father even now might be writhing under his grasp & Ernest might be dead at his feet \u2013 This reflection made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up & resolved to return to Geneva with ", "all", " possible speed. There were no horses to be procured and I must return by the lake but the wind was ", "unfavourable", " and the rain fell in torrents. It was however hardly yet morning and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night \u2013I hired a number of men to row and took an oar myself for I had always experienced relief from mental ", "torment", " in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt & the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion\u2013I threw down the oar & leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose\u2014If I looked up I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier ", "time", " and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow & a recollection \u2013 tears streamed from my eyes \u2013 I looked on the lake the rain had ceased for a moment & I saw the fish play in the waters as I had done but a few hours before \u2013 they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as great & sudden change \u2013 The sun might shine or the clouds might lower \u2013 but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before \u2013 A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness. No creature had ever been so miserable as I was so frightful an event was single upon earth. But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event \u2013 Mine has been a tale horrors\u2013 I have reached their ac me and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you now that one by one my friends were snatched away & I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted & I must tell in few words What remains of my hideous narration. I arrived at Geneva. My fathe & Ernest yet lived but the former was unable to bear the miserable tidings that I bore \u2014 I see him now excellent & venerable old man \u2013 his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm & delight \u2013 his neice his more than daughter whom he doated on with all the affection of a man who in the decline of life having few affections clings ", "more earnestly", " to those that remain. Cursed Cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs & doomed him to ", "waste", " in wretchedness. He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated round him \u2013 An applapetic fit was brought on & in a few days he died in my arms. What then became of me? I know not\u2014I lost sensation & chains & darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me \u2013 sometimes indeed I dreamed that I wandered in flowery meadows & pleasant vales with the friends of my youth \u2013 But I awoke & found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed but by degrees I regained a clear conception of my miseries & situation & was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad & ", "During", " many months as I understood a solitary cell had been my habitation. \u2013  But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not as I awakened to reason at the same time awakened to vengeance. As the memory of past misfortunes prest upom me I began to reflect on their cause \u2013 The monster whom I had created\u2014the miserable d\u00e6mon whom I had sent abroard in the world for my destruction \u2014 I was possessed by a madening rage when I thought of him and desired & ardently prayed that I might have him with in my grasp to wreak ", "a", " great & signal ", "revenge", " on his cursed head. Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him & for this purpose about a month after my release I repaired to a criminal judge in the town & told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. The magistrate listened to me with attention & kindness \u2013 Be assured, sir, said he no pains or exertions on my part have been or shall be spared to discover the ", "villain. ", "I thank you, I replied, listen therefore to the deposition I have to make. It is a indeed a tale so strange that I fear you would not credit it were there not somthing in truth which however wonderful forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream & I have no motive for falsehood. My manner as I said this was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart the resolution to pursue my destroyer to death & this purpose quieted my agony & ", "provisionally", " reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness & precision \u2013 marking dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as I continued he became more attentive & interrested \u2013I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise unmi", "ngled", " with disbelief was painted on his countenance. When I had concluded my narration I said. This is the being whom I accuse and for whose detection & punishment I call upon you ", "to", " exert your whole power It is your duty as a magistrate and I believe & hope your feelings as a man do not revolt from the execution of ", "those", " functions on this occasion.\u2014. This address caused a considerable change in the phisiognomy of my auditor He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and ghosts but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence of it the whole tide of his incredulity returned \u2013 He however answered mildly. I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance Who can follow an animal ", "which", " can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves & dens where no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes & no one may conjecture to what place he has wandered ", "or", " what ", "region", " he may now inhabit. I do not doubt, I replied, that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit \u2013 And if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois & destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts \u2014 you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment that is his desert. As I spoke rage sparkled in my eyes \u2013 The magistrate was intimidated You are mistaken, said he I will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes \u2013 But I fear from what you ", "have", " yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and that \u2014 while every proper measure is pursued you should endeavour to make up your mind to a di", "s", "appointment. That cannot be\u2013 said I wildly\u2014But all that I can say will be of little avail; My revenge is of no moment to you yet while I allow it to be a vice I confess that it is the devouring & only passion of my soul; my rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer whom I have turned loose upon society still exists \u2013  You refuse my just demand \u2013 I have but one resource and I devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction \u2013 I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this there was frenzy in my manner & something I doubt not of that haught", "y", " fierceness ", "which", " the martyrs of old were said to have possessed \u2014 But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion & heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child & reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium \u2014 Man \u2013 I cried, how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom.\u2013 cease you know not what it is you say. I broke from the house & angry & disturbed retired to meditate some other mode of action. my present situation was", " one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.", " \u2013 I was hurried away by fury \u2013 Revenge alone", " endowed", " me with strength, ", "& composure", " \u2013 It modelled my feelings ", "&", " allowed me to be calculating and calm ", "at periods when otherwise", " delirium or death would have been my portion. My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever.\u2013 My country which when I was happy & beloved was dear me now in my adversity became hateful I provided myself with a small sum of money together with a few jewels ", "which", " had belonged to my mother & departed. And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life \u2013 I have traversed a vast", " portion", " of ", "the earth", " and ", "have", " endured all the hardships", " which", " travellers in desarts & barbarous countries are wont to meet \u2013 How I have lived I hardly know many times ", "have", " I ", "stretched my failing limbs", " on the sandy plain exhausted & far from succour, & prayed for death \u2013 But revenge kept me alive \u2013 I dared not die & leave my adversary in being.\u2014. When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled and I wandered many hours around the confines of the town uncertain what path ", "I should", " pursue As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetary, where William, Elizabeth and my father reposed \u2013 I entered it & approached the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently", " agitated", " by the breeze \u2014 The night was nearly dark and the scene would have been affecting and solemn even to an uninterested observer \u2013the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but seen not a round the head of the mourner. the deep grief ", "which this scene had at first excited", " felt quickly gave way to rage & despair \u2013 They were dead and I lived \u2013 Their murderer also lived & to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the earth and with quirering lips exclaimed \u2013 By the Sacred earth ", "on which", " I kneel , by the shades that wander near me. By the deep & eternal grief that I feel I swear \u2014 And by thee oh night and by the spirits that preside over thee I swear to pursue the d\u00e6mon who caused this misery untill he or I shall ", "perish", " in a mortal conflict \u2013 For this purpose I will preserve my life \u2014 To execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun & ", "tread the", " green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever \u2013 And I call on you spirits of the dead & you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid me & conduct me in my work. Let the cursed & hellish monster drink deep of agony \u2013 Let him feel the despair that now torments me. I had begun my adjuration with solemnity & an awe that almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard & approved my devotion \u2013 But the furies possessed me as I concluded it & rage choaked my utterance. I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud & fiendish laugh\u2013 It rung my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it and I felt as if all Hell surrounded me with mockery and laughing\u2014Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was heard and I was reserved for vengeance \u2013 The laughter died away when a well known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper \u2013 I am satisfied, miserable wretch, you have determined to live & I am satisfied \u2013 I darted towards the place from which the sound proceeded but the ", "devil", " eluded my grasp. suddenly the broard disk of the moon arose and shone fully upon ", "his ghastly & distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal speed.

The peasantry were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced forth to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured. The triumph of my enemy encreased with the difficulty of my labours One inscription that he left was in these words \u2013 Prepare \u2013 your toils only begin \u2013rap yourself in furs & provide food for we shall soon enter on a journey where you sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred\" My courage & perseverance were inspired with new strength by these difficulties I resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling heaven to support me I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense desarts untill the occean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon \u2013Oh How unlike it was to the blue seas of the south Covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness & ruggedness\u2014The greeks wept when they saw the mediterranean from the hills of Asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils \u2013 I did not weep but I knelt down & thanked my guiding spirit with a full heart for conducting me safety towards the place where I hoped notwithstanding my adversarys threat to meet & grapple with him \u2014 some weeks before", " this period ", "I had procured a sledge & dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but I found that as before I had daily lost the advantage in my persuit I now gained on him so much that when I for the first time saw the occean\u2013 he was but one days journey in advance & I hoped soon to intercept him With new courage therefore I pressed on & in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea shore. I enquired concerning the fiend & gained every information \u2013A gigantic ", "monster ", "they said had arrived the night before \u2013Armed with a gun and many pistols & putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance, ", "he", " had", " carried off", " their store of winter food & placing it in a sledge to draw which he", " had", " seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs \u2013 he had harnessed them\u2013 & the same night to the joy of the horror struck villagers", " had ", "pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land & they conjectured that he must be speedily destroyed in the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frost.\u2013.

Yet at the idea that the fiend should live & be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned & like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round me & instigated me to toil & revenge I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the ruggedness of the", " frozen ", "ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions I departed from land. How many days have passed since then I know not but I have endured misery ", "which", " nothing but the eternal sentiment ", "of a just revenge ", "burn", "ing", " within my heart could have enabled me to support.

I followed\u2014 but still the dew dimmed my sight untill giving way to the emotions that oppressed me I wept aloud. But this was not the time for delay I disincumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours repose which was absolutely necessary & yet which was bitterly irksome to me I continued my path \u2014 The sledge was still visible nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice rock ", "concealed", " it ", "with its intervening crags.", " I indeed perceptibly gained on ", "the object of my pursuit.", " And after about another ", "days", " journey I beheld myself at no more than ", "half a mile", " distant.

What a glorious creature must he have been in his days of prosperity when he is thus noble & godlike in ruin \u2013 He seems to feel his own worth & the greatness of his fall.

This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have sunk for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief; those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures \u2013 When I reflected on the work that I had compleated, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive & rational animal I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this feeling which supported me now serves ", "only", " to ", "plunge", " me lower in the dust\u2014 All my speculations & hopes are as nothing and like the Archangel who aspired to omnipotence I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid yet my powers of application were intense \u2013 by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man\u2013 Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete \u2013I trod heaven in my thoughts \u2013 now exulting in my powers \u2013 now burning with the idea of their consequences.

August 31th My beloved Sister. I write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant if I am ever doomed to see again dear England & the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I persuaded to be my companions look at me for aid but I have none to bestow. There is somthing terribly appalling in our situation Yet my courage & hopes do not desert me \u2014 We may survive & if we do not \u2013I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca & die with a good heart. Yet what, Margaret, will be your state \u2013 You will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return \u2013 Years will pass and you will have visitings of despair & yet be cheered by hope. Oh my beloved sister the sicknening failings of your heartfelt expectations are in prospect more terrible to me than my own death \u2013But you have a husband and lovely children\u2014 you may be happy \u2014 Heaven bless you & make you so. My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion \u2013 He endeavours to fill me with hope \u2013 And talks as if life were a thing which he loved He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators, who have attempted the same sea. In spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the benefit of his eloquence \u2013 when he speaks they no longer despair \u2013 he rouzes their energies & they believe these vast mountains of ice ", "are", " mole hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. this is but transitory and each days expectation delayed, fills them fear & I almost dread ", "the", " mutiny ", "of despair", " September 6th A scene has just passed of such ", "uncommon", " inter rest that although it is highly probable that the papers may never reach you, my dear Margeret, yet I cannot forbear recording it. We are still surrounded by ", "mountains of", " ice still in imminent danger ", "of being crushed in their conflict.", "\u2014 The cold is excessive & many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave admidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has declined daily in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is ex", "h", "austed & when suddenly rouzed to any exertion he speedily sinks again ", "into", " apparent lifelessness. I mentioned my last letter the fears I had of mutiny. This morning as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was rouzed by half a dozen of the sailors who desired admission into the cabin they entered & their leader adressed me. He told me that he & his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make a demand which in justice I could not refuse. We were immured by ice & would probably never escape but they feared that if, as was possible the ice should be dissipated and a free passage opened I should be rash enough to continue my voyage & lead them to fresh dangers after they ", "might", " happily ", "have", " surmounted ", "this.", " They desired therefore that I should make a solemn promise  if the vessel should be freed, ", "that", " I would instantly direct my course to ", "Archangel. ", "This speech troubled me. I had not despaired nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I in justice, or even in possibility refuse th", "i", "s", " demand", ". I hesitated before I answered when Frankenstein who had at first been silent & indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now rouzed himself. His eyes sparkled and his cheek flushed ", "was", " with momentary vigour. Turning to the men he said; What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from your design? Did you ot call this a glorious expedition & ", "wherefore", " was it ", "glorious?", " Not because the way was smooth & placid as a ", "southern sea", " but because it was full of dangers & terror \u2013 because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth & your courage exhibited\u2013 Because death & danger surrounded you & these you were to brave & overcome. For this was it a glorious; for this was it an honorable under taking. You were to be hereafter hailed as the benefactors of your species \u2013 our names adored as the brave men who encountered death for honor & ", "the benefit of mankind.", " \u2013 And now behold with the first ", "imagination of danger", " \u2013or if you will \u2013 The first mighty & terrific trial of your courage you shrink away & are content to be handed down as men who had not strength to endure cold & peril \u2013 And so poor souls they were chilly & returned to their warm fire sides\u2013Why that requires not this preperation \u2013e need not have come thus far & dragged your Captain to the shame of a defeat to prove yourselves cowards. Oh be men or be more than men \u2013 be steady to your purposes & firm as rock. this ice is not made of such stuff ", "as your hearts might be.", " it is mutable & cannot withand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows\u2013 return as heroes who have fought & conquered & who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe. He spoke thus with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech \u2013 with an eye so full of high design & heroism that can you wonder that the men were moved \u2013They looked at one another & were unable to reply. I spoke. I told them to retire & consider of what had been said. That I would not lead them further north if they streneously desired the contrary but that I hoped that with reflection their courage would return. They retired and I turned to my friend but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life. How all this will terminate I know not. But I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled\u2013Yet I fear ", "such", " will be my fate The men unsupported by the ideas of glory and honor can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships. September 7th The die is cast. I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted\u2013 by cowardice and indecision \u2013 I come back ignorant & dissap pointed \u2013It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience \u2013. September 12th It is past. I am returning to ", "Archangel", ". I have lost my hopes of utility & glory \u2013I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail the bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister \u2013 And while I am wafted towards England & towards you I will not despair. September 9 th The ice began to move and roarings like thunder was heard at a distance as the ", "islands", " split & cracked in every direction. We were in the most eminent peril \u2013 But as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness encreased to such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north \u2013 a breeze sprung from that quarter \u2013", "and", "on the 11 th the passage towards the south ", "became", " free When the sailors saw this & that their return towards their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumutuous joy broke from them loud & long continued.\u2013 Frankenstein who was dozing awoke de & asked the reason ", "of the tumult", "\u2013 I was unable to reply. He asked again \u2013 They shout I said be cause they will soon return to England. Do you then really return. Alas yes. I cannot with stand their demands \u2013 I cannot lead them unwillingly to dangerer & I must return. Do so if you will, but I will not. You may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to by heaven and I dare not. I am weak, spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength \u2013 Saying this endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back & fainted. It was long before he was restored I often thought that life was entirely extinct \u2013 At length he opened his eyes \u2013 but he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak \u2013 The", " surgeon,", " gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live. His sentence was pronounced & I could only grieve & be patient. I sat by his bed watching him \u2013his eyes were closed and I thought he slept. But presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said\u2013 Alas! the strength I relied on is gone \u2013 I feel that I shall soon die and he my enemy & persecutor may still be in being. Think not, Walton, than in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred & ardent desire of revenge that I once expressed but I feel myself justified in desiring the monsters death. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I crea ted a rational creature & was bound towards him to assure as far as in me lay his happiness & well being\u2013 this was my duty\u2013 but there was one still paramount to this. My duties towards my fellow creatures had greater claims because they included a greater portion of happiness or misery\u2013. Urged by this view I refused and I did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature\u2013 He shewed unparelled malignity. He destroyed my friend \u2013 he devoted to destruction beings who ", "possessed exquisite", " sensations \u2013 happiness & wisdom or do I know here this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die \u2013 The task of his destruction was mine but I have failed. Once when actuated by selfish and vicious motives I asked you to undertake my unfinished work and I renew this request now when I am only induced to make it by reason & virtue. Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country & friends to fulfil this ", "task,", " \u2013And now that you are returning to England you have little chance of meeting ", "with", " him.\u2013 But the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties I leave to you \u2014 My judgement & ideas are already disturbed by ", "the near approach of", " death \u2013 I dare not ask you to do what I think right for I may still be misled by passion. ", "That he should live, to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects this hour when I momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton. Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science & discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed. His voice became fainter as he spoke; & at length exhausted by his effort he sunk into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak, but was unable\u2014 he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed forever while the irradiation of a gentle smile past away from his lips. Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious sprit? What can I say that will make you understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate & feeble. My tears flow- My life is overshadowed with a cloud of dissappointment. But I journey towards England, & I may there find consolation. I am interrupted\u0097 what do these sounds portend? It is midnight. The breeze blows fairly; & the watch on deck scarcely stir\u2014 Again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser- it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise & examine\u2014 Good night my sister- \u2013. Great God! What a scene has just taken place- I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final & wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated, & admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth & distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin his face was hid by long locks of ragged hair\u2013 but one vast hand was extended, in colour & apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach; he ceased to utter exclamations of grief & horror, & sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet apalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, as recollecting what were my duties with respect to this destroyer, I called on him to stay. He paused \u2013 Looking on me with wonder, & again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence; and every feature & gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrolable passion\u2014 That is also my victim! he exclaimed In his murder my crimes are consummated \u2014 the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! O Frankenstein \u2013 generous & self devoted being what does it avail that I ask thee now to pardon me. Wherefore do I seek to perish in thy stead after I have irretrievably destroyed thee, by destroying those thou lovedst Alas he is cold.. he may not answer me. His voice seemed suffocated, & my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, now were suspended by a mixture of curiosity & compassion. I approached this tremendous being\u2013 I dared not again raise my looks upon his face\u2014 there was something so scaring & unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but his presence was as a burthen which held me dumb, & the words died on my lips\u2014. The monster continued to utter wild & incoherent reproaches.. At length I gathered resolution to speak, in a pause as it were in the tempest of his passion \u2014 Your repentance is now superflous: I said, If you had listened to the voice of conscience, & heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity; Frankenstein would yet have lived. And do you dream \u2014 said the D\u00e6mon, do you think that I was then dead to agony & remorse. \u2013 He\u2013 he p continued, pointing to the corpse, he suffered not more in consummation of the deed; oh not the ten thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think ye that the groans of Clerval were music to my ear. My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love & sympathy, & when wrenched by misery to vice & hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine\u2014 After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland heart- broken & overcome - I pitied Frankenstein My pity ammounted to horror \u2013 I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he\u2013 the author at once of my existence and of all its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness \u2014that whilst he accumulated upon me wretchedness & despair, he sought his own enjoyment in feelings & passions from the indulgence of which I was barred\u2014 then impotent envy & bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat & resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myselft a deadly torture.. but I was the slave not the master of an impulse which I detested but could not disobey. \u2013 Yet when she died! Nay then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far I had no choice but to adapt nature to an element which I had chosen willingly. The completion of my demoniacal design thenceforward became an insatiable pasion\u2014 And nowt is ended\u2014 there is my last victim!\" I was at first touched by the expression of his misery, yet when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence & persuasion, & when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was re- kindled within me. \u2014 Wretch, I said, it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation which you have made \u2013 you throw a torch into a pile of buildings, & when they are consumed you sit among the ruins & lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you lament still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeamce. It is not pity that you feel\u2013 you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.\u2014\u2014. Oh! it is not thus\u2014 not thus \u2013 interrupted the Being=yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. \u2013 Yet, I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue. I desired that the feelings of happiness & affection with the hope of which my whole \"being\" once overflowed, should be participated \u2013 But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, & happiness & affection are turned into bitter & loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am contented to suffer alone whilst my sufferings shall endure. When I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence & opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame & of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which I was so eminently capable of bringing forth. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour & lf devotion. But now vice has degraded me neath the meanest animal. No crimes no mischief, no malignity no misery can be found parallell with mine. When I call over the frightful catalogue of my deeds I cannot believe that I am he, whose thoughts were once filled with sublime & transcendent visions of the beauty & the majesty of goodness \u2013 But it is even so \u2013 The fallen Angel becomes a malignant devil \u2013 Yet even that enemy of God & man had friends & associates in his desolation. I am quite alone. You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes & his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours & months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were forever ardent & craving. Still I desired love & fellowship, & I was stil spurned \u2014 Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal whi all human kind sinned against me? \u2014 Why dyou not hate Felix who drove his friend fhis door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy thsaviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuo & immaculate beings. I the miserable & the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at, & kicked & trampled upon\u2014 Even now my bloo boils at the recollection of this injustice. But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely & the helpless. I have strangled the innocent as they slept, & grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love & admiration among men, to misery: I have pursued him even to that irremdiable ruin. There he lies, white & cold death. You hate me but your abhorrence cannot al that with which I regard myself. I look the hands which executed that deed, I think the heart in which the imagination of it was ncieved, & long for the moment when they will eet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts o more. Fear not that I shall be the instrument of uture mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither ours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being, & accomplish that which must be done; but it requires my own. Do not fear that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifize. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me hither; & shall seek with rapid steps, the most northern extremity of the globe. I shall collect my funeral pile, & consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious & unhallowed ", "wretch", " who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being and when I shall be no more, the very rembrance of us both will speedily perish. I sno longer see the sun or stars, or feel the wind play on my cheeks. Light, feeling & sense wi pass away. And in this condition must I find happiness.\u2013 Some years ago when the images whi this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer, & he the rustling of leaves & the chirping of birds, & these were all to me, I should have wep to die, & now it is my only consolation. Pollut by crimes & torn by the bitterest remorse where ca I find rest but in death. Farewell. I leave you, & in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein. If thou wert yet alive & yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than my destruction. But it was not so. You sought my extinction that I might not cause greater wretchedness; & if yet in some mode unknown to me, thou haste not ceased to think & feel, thou desirest not my life for my own misery. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine: for the bitter sting of remorse may not cease to Rankle in my wounds, until death shall close them forever. But soon, he cried with sad & solemn enthusiasm, I shall die, & what I now feel be no longer felt. . . Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly; & exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away. My ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks will surely not think thus. Adieu. He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon an ice raft which lay close to the vessel; he was soon borne away by the waves, & lost in the darkness of distance."]
